Histone H1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The existence of histone H1 in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has long been debated. In this report we describe the presence of histone H1 in yeast. YPL127c, a gene encoding a protein with a high degree of similarity to histone H1 from other species was sequenced as part of the contribution of the Montreal Yeast Genome Sequencing Group to chromosome XVI. To reflect this similarity, the gene designation has been changed HHO1 (Histone H One). The HHO1 gene is highly expressed as poly A+ RNA in yeast. Although deletion of this gene had no detectable effect on cell growth, viability or mating, it significantly altered the expression of beta-galactosidase from a CYC1-lacZ reporter. Fluorescence observed in cells expressing a histone H1-GFP protein fusion indicated that histone H1 is localized to the nucleus.
