Isolation and subcloning analysis of functional centromere DNA (CEN11) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XI.

We have cloned segments of yeast DNA containing the centromere XI-linked MET14 gene. This was done by selecting directly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for complementation of a met14 mutation after transformation with a hybrid plasmid DNA genomic library. Genetic evidence indicates that functional centromere DNA (CEN11) from chromosome XI is also contained on the segment of S. cerevisiae DNA cloned in pYe(MET14)2. This plasmid is maintained stably in budding S. cerevisiae cultures and segregates predominantly 2+:20- through meiosis. The CEN11 element has been subcloned in vector YRp7' on an S. cerevisiae DNA fragment 900 base pairs in length [pYe(CEN11)10]. The mitotic and meiotic behavior of plasmids containing CEN11 plus a DNA replicator (ars) indicates that the centromere DNA sequences enable these plasmids to function as true minichromosomes in S. cerevisiae.
