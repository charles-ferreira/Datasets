A nuclear mutation reversing a biased transmission of yeast mitochondrial DNA.

The highly biased transmission of p- mitochondrial DNA that occurs in hypersuppressive matings between p- and p+ cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is thought to be a consequence of the replication advantage of the p- mtDNA. A nuclear gene, MGT1, that is required for this displacement of p+ mtDNA from zygotic clones has been identified through mutation. When one haploid parent carries the mgt1 allele, transmission of p- mtDNA is substantially reduced. When both haploid parents carry the mgt1 allele, p- mtDNA is essentially eliminated from the zygotic progeny. Thus in the absence of the MGT1 gene there is a switch in the transmission bias; p+ mtDNA rather than the hypersuppressive p- mtDNA is inherited by most zygotic clones. In contrast to its semi-dominant behavior in haploid matings, mgt1 behaves as a recessive allele in diploid matings since the p+ genome in MGT1/mgt1 diploids is efficiently displaced when mated with a MGT1/mgt1 hypersuppressive p- diploid strain. We find that p+ genomes can be comaintained along with hypersuppressive p- mtDNA for extended periods in clonal lines derived from MGT1 x mgt1 matings. However, as expected from the recessive nature of the mgt1 mutation, these p+ genomes are eventually eliminated. Our work indicates that MGT1 plays a crucial role in the competition for inheritance between hypersuppressive p- mtDNAs and the p+ mitochondrial genome. The MGT1 gene product may be a component of a mtDNA replication system that acts preferentially at the rep sequences found in hypersuppressive mtDNAs.
