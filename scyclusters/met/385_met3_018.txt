Cloning of a cDNA encoding ATP sulfurylase from Arabidopsis thaliana by functional expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

ATP sulfurylase, the first enzyme in the sulfate assimilation pathway of plants, catalyzes the formation of adenosine phosphosulfate from ATP and sulfate. Here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding ATP sulfurylase (APS1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. APS1 was isolated by its ability to alleviate the methionine requirement of an ATP sulfurylase mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). Expression of APS1 correlated with the presence of ATP sulfurylase enzyme activity in cell extracts. APS1 is a 1748-bp cDNA with an open reading frame predicted to encode a 463-amino acid, 51,372-D protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of APS1 is similar to ATP sulfurylase of S. cerevisiae, with which it is 25% identical. Two lines of evidence indicate that APS1 encodes a chloroplast form of ATP sulfurylase. Its predicted amino-terminal sequence resembles a chloroplast transit peptide; and the APS1 polypeptide, synthesized in vitro, is capable of entering isolated intact chloroplasts. Several genomic DNA fragments that hybridize with the APS1 probe were identified. The APS1 cDNA hybridizes to three species of mRNA in leaves (1.85, 1.60, and 1.20 kb) and to a single species of mRNA in roots (1.85 kb).
