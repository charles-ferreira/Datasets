Functional analysis of the sporulation-specific SPR6 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The SPR6 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a moderately abundant RNA that is present at high levels only during sporulation. The gene contains a long open reading frame that could encode a hydrophilic protein approximately 21 kDa in size. This protein is probably produced by the yeast, because the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli is expressed during sporulation when fused to SPR6 in the expected reading frame. SPR6 is inessential for sporulation; mutants that lack SPR6 activity sporulate normally and produce viable ascospores. Nonetheless, the SPR6 gene encodes a function that is relevant to sporulating cells; the wild-type allele can enhance sporulation in strains that are defective for several SPR functions. SPR6 is located on chromosome V, 14.4 centimorgans centromere-distal to MET6.
