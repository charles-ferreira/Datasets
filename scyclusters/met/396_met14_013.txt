Location of the genes that control induction of the allantoin-degrading enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In an effort to understand the regulation of allantoin degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated two classes of mutants, each defective in the induction process associated with production of the pathway enzymes. Mutation at one locus (DAL80) results in constitutive expression of the genes involved in allantoin catabolism. Mutation at the second locus (DAL-81) results in the loss of ability to induce these enzymes. This report describes genetic data indicating that the DAL80 and DAL81 loci are situated approximately 13 cM from the centromere on the right arm of chromosome XI and 9 cM proximal to the DAL1 locus on chromosome IX, respectively.
