Genome-wide expression screens indicate a global role for protein kinase CK2 in chromatin remodeling.

Protein kinase CK2, a vital, pleiotropic and highly conserved serine/threonine phosphotransferase is involved in transcription-directed signaling, gene control and cell cycle regulation and is suspected to play a role in global processes. Searching for these global roles, we analyzed the involvement of CK2 in gene expression at cell cycle entry by using genome-wide screens. Comparing expression profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type strains with strains with regulatory or catalytic subunits of CK2 deleted, we found significant alterations in the expression of genes at all cell cycle phases and often in a subunit- and isoform-specific manner. Roughly a quarter of the genes known to be regulated by the cell cycle are affected. Functionally, the genes are involved with cell cycle entry, progression and exit, including spindle pole body formation and dynamics. Strikingly, most CK2-affected genes exhibit no common transcriptional control features, and a considerable proportion of temporarily altered genes encodes proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and modification, including chromatin assembly, (anti-)silencing and histone (de-)acetylation. In addition, various metabolic pathway and nutritional supply genes are affected. Our data are compatible with the idea that CK2 acts at different levels of cellular organization and that CK2 has a global role in transcription-related chromatin remodeling.
