Functional Analysis of six novel ORFs on the left arm of Chromosome XII of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals three of them responding to S-starvation.

Six novel Open Reading Frames (ORFs) located on the left arm of the chromosome XII (YLL061w, YLL060c, YLL059c, YLL058w, YLL057c and YLL056c) have been analysed using either short-flanking homology (SFH) or long-flanking homology (LFH) gene replacement. Sporulation and tetrad analysis showed none of these ORFs to be essential for vegetative growth. The standard EUROFAN growth tests failed to reveal any obvious phenotypes resulting from deletion of each of the ORFs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that YLL061w is probably an amino acid permease for S-methylmethionine and that YLL060c encodes a glutathione transferase which is involved in cellular detoxification, while YLL058w may play a role in sulphur-containing amino-acid metabolism, YLL057c in sulphonate catabolism and YLL056c in stress response. The transcription of three ORFs (YLL061w, YLL057c and YLL056c) has been shown to increase more than 10-fold under sulphate starvation. Replacement cassettes, comprising the kanMX marker flanked by each ORF's promoter and terminator regions, were cloned into pUG7. All the cognate clones, were generated using direct PCR products amplified from genomic DNA or using gap-repair. All clones and strains produced have been deposited in the EUROFAN genetic stock centre (EUROSCARF, Frankfurt). Copyright 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.
