Role of hydrosulfide ions (HS-) in methylmercury resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Methylmercury-resistant mutants were obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They were divided into two complementation groups, met2 (homoserine O-acetyltransferase deficiency) and met15 (enzyme deficiency unknown), as reported previously. It was found that met15 was allelic to met17 (O-acetylserine and O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase deficiency). Methylmercury toxicity was counteracted by exogenously added HS-, and both met2 and met17 (met15) mutants overproduced H2S. On the basis of these results, we conclude that met2 and met17 (met15) cause accumulation of hydrosulfide ions in the cell and that the increased level of hydrosulfide is responsible for detoxification of methylmercury.
