Dissection of the DNA binding domain of yeast Zn-finger protein Rme1p, a repressor of meiotic activator IME1.

A series of deletion mutants of the yeast Zn-finger protein Rme1p (Repressor of Meiosis) fused with maltose binding protein (MBP) were constructed, purified, and characterized to examine the DNA binding domain. It was shown by gel retardation assay that the DNA binding domain of Rme1p was attributed to C-terminal amino acid residues 171 to 300. All three Zn-fingers are involved in the DNA binding domain, but they are not sufficient for DNA binding ability. Notably, the C-terminal region (residues 285-300) is essential for DNA binding. Provided that the region folds into alpha-helix, the basic amino acid residues may form a ridge on one side of the helix, whereas the hydrophobic residues may form it on the other side. Thus, the DNA binding domain of Rme1p would be dissected two regions. The roles of C-terminal region in DNA recognition will be discussed.
