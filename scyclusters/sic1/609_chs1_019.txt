Chitin synthetase distribution on the yeast plasma membrane.

Purified, intact yeast plasma membranes were allowed to synthesize chitin, and the nascent chains of polysaccharide were observed either by the fluorescence produced with a brightener or by autoradiography. By both methods, it was concluded that the newly formed chitin emerged at many sites on each membrane. Thus, the synthetase that catalyzes chitin formation has a similar distribution. Since chitin synthetase is found mainly in a zymogen form, these results confirm the hypothesis that initiation of the chitinous primary septum of Saccharomyces occurs by localized activation of the uniformly distributed zymogen.
