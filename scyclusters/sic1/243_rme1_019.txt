The sporulation capable (sca) mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an allele of the SIR2 gene.

We have used the special properties of the spo13-1 mutation in order to study the regulation of yeast meiosis by the mating type loci. We have found that both the rme1-1 mutation and the sca mutation allow haploid meiosis in spo13-1 strains. Therefore, haploid meiosis is regulated in the same manner as diploid meiosis. Unlike rme1-1, the sca mutation allows meiosis through derepression of the silent mating type cassettes; sca strains can sporulate only because they express both MATa and MAT alpha information. We have found further that sca is an allele of SIR2, one of the genes involved in repression of the silent cassettes. Therefore, the RME1 gene is the only known candidate for a master negative regulator through which the MAT locus controls meiosis.
