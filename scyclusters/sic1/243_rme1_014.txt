An RME1-independent pathway for sporulation control in Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts through IME1 transcript accumulation.

The RES1-1 mutation was isolated on the basis of its ability to allow MATa/MAT alpha diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to express a late sporulation-regulated gene, SPR3, in the presence of excess copies of RME1. RME1 is a repressor of meiosis that is normally expressed in cells that lack the a1/alpha 2 repressor encoded by MAT. The RES1-1 mutation also supports sporulation in mat-insufficient diploids. This phenotype does not result from a failure to express RME1 and is not due to activation of the silent copies of mating type information. RES1-1 activates sporulation by allowing IME1 accumulation in all cell types, irrespective of the presence of the MAT products. IME1 is still responsive to RME1 in RES1-1 cells, since double mutants (rme1 RES1-1) that are deficient at MAT can sporulate better than either single mutant. RES1-1 is not an allele of IME1.
