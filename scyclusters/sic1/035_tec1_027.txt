TEC1, a gene involved in the activation of Ty1 and Ty1-mediated gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: cloning and molecular analysis.

Ty and Ty-mediated gene expression observed in haploid cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on several determinants, some of which are required for the expression of haploid-specific genes. We report here the cloning and molecular analysis of TEC1. TEC1 encodes a 486-amino-acid protein that is a trans-acting factor required for full Ty1 expression and Ty1-mediated gene activation. However, mutation or deletion of the TEC1 gene had little effect on total Ty2 transcript levels. Our analysis provides clear evidence that TEC1 is not involved in mating or sporulation processes. Unlike most of the proteins involved in Ty and adjacent gene expression, the product of TEC1 has no known cellular function. Although there was no mating-type effect on TEC1 expression, our results indicate that the TEC1 and the a/alpha diploid controls on Ty1 expression are probably not cumulative.
