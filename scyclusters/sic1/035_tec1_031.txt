The mating factor response pathway regulates transcription of TEC1, a gene involved in pseudohyphal differentiation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The transcription factor Tec1 is involved in pseudohyphal differentiation and agar-invasive growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The sole element in the TEC1 promoter that has thus far been shown to control Tec1 function is the filament response element. We find that the TEC1 promoter also contains several pheromone response element sequences which are likely to be functional: TEC1 transcription is induced by mating factor, cell cycle regulated and dependent on the Ste4, Ste18 and Ste5 components of the mating factor signal transduction pathway. Using alleles of the transcription factor Ste12 that are defective in DNA binding, transcriptional induction or cooperativity with other transcription factors, we find little correlation between TEC1 transcript levels and agar-invasive growth.
