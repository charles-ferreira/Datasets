Cooperative binding interactions required for function of the Ty1 sterile responsive element.

The Ste12p transcription factor controls the expression of Ty1 transposable element insertion mutations and genes whose products are required for mating in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The binding site for Ste12p is a consensus DNA sequence known as a pheromone response element (PRE). Upstream activating sequences (UASs) derived from known Ste12p-dependent genes have previously been characterized to require either multiple PREs or a single PRE coupled to a binding site for a second protein. The Ste12p-dependent UAS from Ty1, called a sterile response element (SRE), is of the second type and is comprised of a PRE and an adjacent TEA (TEF-1, Tec1, and AbaA motif) DNA consensus sequence (TCS). In this report, we show by UV cross-linking analysis that two proteins, Ste12p and a protein with an apparent size of 72 kDa, directly contact the Ty1 SRE. Other experiments show that Tec1p is required for formation of the Ty1 SRE protein-DNA complex and is physically present in the complex. These results establish a direct role for Tec1p in the Ty1 SRE and yet another set of combinatorial interactions that achieve a qualitatively distinct mode of transcriptional regulation with Ste12p.
