Positive and negative elements upstream of the meiosis-specific glucoamylase gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The SGA1 gene encoding glucoamylase is specifically expressed late in meiotic development of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that accumulation of both enzyme activity and transcripts was regulated negatively by both nutritional signals and a haploid-specific negative regulator gene of meiosis. RME1, and positively by the inducer genes for meiosis, IME1 and IME2. To study the role of sequences upstream of the SGA1 gene in its expression and regulation, we generated internal deletions in the 5' non-coding region of the gene and chimeric genes with portions of the upstream sequence inserted into a reporter gene. By analyzing the expression of these genes, we have identified both a 19 bp upstream activation sequence (UAS) and a 49 bp negatively regulating element (NRE). The UAS activated transcription with no requirement for heterozygosity at the mating-type locus, but this activation was still under negative control by nutrients. The NRE showed no UAS-like activity but conferred IME2-dependent (or meiosis-specific) expression on a heterologous promoter. These results suggest that meiosis-specific expression of the SGA1 gene is established by a regulatory hierarchy including positive and negative factors, the actions of which are mediated through the two separate upstream regulatory elements, UAS and NRE, respectively. Also, that two independently acting cascades exist for the regulation of SGA1 expression: one transduces both the mating-type and nutritional signals and includes the IME2 product, which acts to relieve the repression through NRE; and another transduces only the nutritional signal independently of the above pathway and inhibits positive factors acting on UAS.
