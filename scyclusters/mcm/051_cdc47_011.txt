Properties of the human nuclear protein p85Mcm. Expression, nuclear localization and interaction with other Mcm proteins.

Recently we identified a cDNA fragment encoding a conserved part of a new human minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) protein, provisionally termed P1.1Mcm3. Here, we report that the protein is most highly related to a yeast cell-division-cycle protein, Cdc47, encoded by the open reading frame YBR1441 on chromosome 11 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The human protein migrates on a polyacrylamide gel with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa and shares areas of significant similarity with the Mcm family of replication proteins. It is, therefore, designated as p85Mcm. Microscopic immuno-fluorescence studies revealed that protein p85Mcm is located in the nuclei of interphase cells, but is evenly distributed throughout the cell during mitosis. The amounts of p85Mcm do not significantly change during the cell cycle, but mRNA levels rise with the beginning of the S phase. However, in vitro differentiation of HL60 cells results in a striking decrease of both p85Mcm mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a role for p85Mcm in proliferating, but not in differentiated cells. Under physiological salt conditions, p85Mcm is a component of a high molecular-mass complex including other Mcm proteins. The complex dissociates at high ionic strength giving rise to stable subcomplexes, one of which contains protein p85Mcm together with Mcm proteins hCdc21 and p1O5Mcm.
