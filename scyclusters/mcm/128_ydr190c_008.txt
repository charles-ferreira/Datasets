An eukaryotic RuvB-like protein (RUVBL1) essential for growth.

A human protein (RUVBL1), consisting of 456 amino acids (50 kDa) and highly homologous to RuvB, was identified by using the 14-kDa subunit of replication protein A (hsRPA3) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. RuvB is a bacterial protein involved in genetic recombination that bears structural similarity to subunits of the RF-C clamp loader family of proteins. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the RUVBL1 gene is located at 3q21, a region with frequent rearrangements in different types of leukemia and solid tumors. RUVBL1 co-immunoprecipitated with at least three other unidentified cellular proteins and was detected in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex purified over multiple chromatographic steps. In addition, two yeast homologs, scRUVBL1 and scRUVBL2 with 70 and 42% identity to RUVBL1, respectively, were revealed by screening the complete Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence. Yeast with a null mutation in scRUVBL1 was nonviable. Thus RUVBL1 is an eukaryotic member of the RuvB/clamp loader family of structurally related proteins from bacteria and eukaryotes that is essential for viability of yeast.
