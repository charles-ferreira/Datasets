Coding sequence and chromosome mapping of the human gene (CDC46) for replication protein hCdc46/Mcm5.

We have isolated the complete cDNA sequence encoding the human homolog of the yeast replication protein Cdc46/Mcm5. The cDNA was used as a probe for chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which localized the human Cdc46 gene (CDC46) to chromosome region 22q13.1--&gt;q13.2. This is the fourth human Mcm gene whose chromosome region has been determined, and it is now apparent that human Mcm genes are widely distributed in the genome. As deduced from the cDNA sequence, human protein hCdc46 is composed of 734 amino acids and contains a central region that is almost 80% identical with the yeast protein. Immunoprecipitation experiments with hCdc46-specific antibodies confirm that essentially all nuclear hCdc46 proteins form a stable dimeric complex with protein P1Mcm3.
