Isolation and characterization of a mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae affected in the FLO1 locus.

A non-flocculent strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected after EMS mutation of a flocculent and heterozygous FLO1 locus diploid. The analysis of 25 asci from this diploid showed in all cases segregation 0F:4NF, thus confirming that it was probably affected in the desired gene. After sporulation and dissection of asci, three haploid strains were chosen, which were altered in the locus FLO1. Crossing these three strains with two other ones having markers for ADE1 and pho11::LEU2, we could map the mutation at ca. 4.3 cM and ca. 37.7 cM from the PHO11 and ADE1 loci respectively.
