Identification of a calcineurin-independent pathway required for sodium ion stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin plays an essential role in ion homeostasis in yeast. In this study, we identify a parallel ion stress response pathway that is independent of the calcineurin signaling pathway. Cells with null alleles in both STD1 and its homologue, MTH1, manifest numerous phenotypes observed in calcineurin mutants, including sodium, lithium, manganese, and hydroxyl ion sensitivity, as well as alpha factor toxicity. Furthermore, increased gene dosage of STD1 suppresses the ion stress phenotypes in calcineurin mutants and confers halotolerance in wild-type cells. However, Std1p functions in a calcineurin-independent ion stress response pathway, since a std1 mth1 mutant is FK506 sensitive under conditions of ion stress. Mutations in other genes known to regulate gene expression in response to changes in glucose concentration, including SNF3, RGT2, and SNF5, also affect cell growth under ion stress conditions. Gene expression studies indicate that the regulation of HAL1 and PMR2 expression is affected by STD1 gene dosage. Taken together, our data demonstrate that response to ion stress requires the participation of both calcineurin-dependent and -independent pathways.
