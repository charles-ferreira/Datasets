The human TFIID components TAF(II)135 and TAF(II)20 and the yeast SAGA components ADA1 and TAF(II)68 heterodimerize to form histone-like pairs.

It has been previously proposed that the transcription complexes TFIID and SAGA comprise a histone octamer-like substructure formed from a heterotetramer of H4-like human hTAF(II)80 (or its Drosophila melanogaster dTAF(II)60 and yeast [Saccharomyces cerevisiae] yTAF(II)60 homologues) and H3-like hTAF(II)31 (dTAF(II)40 and yTAF(II)17) along with two homodimers of H2B-like hTAF(II)20 (dTAF(II)30alpha and yTAF(II)61/68). However, it has not been formally shown that hTAF(II)20 heterodimerizes via its histone fold. By two-hybrid analysis with yeast and biochemical characterization of complexes formed by coexpression in Escherichia coli, we showed that hTAF(II)20 does not homodimerize but heterodimerizes with hTAF(II)135. Heterodimerization requires the alpha2 and alpha3 helices of the hTAF(II)20 histone fold and is abolished by mutations in the hydrophobic face of the hTAF(II)20 alpha2 helix. Interaction with hTAF(II)20 requires a domain of hTAF(II)135 which shows sequence homology to H2A. This domain also shows homology to the yeast SAGA component ADA1, and we show that yADA1 heterodimerizes with the histone fold region of yTAF(II)61/68, the yeast hTAF(II)20 homologue. These results are indicative of a histone fold type of interaction between hTAF(II)20-hTAF(II)135 and yTAF(II)68-yADA1, which therefore constitute novel histone-like pairs in the TFIID and SAGA complexes.
