Transcription activation in cells lacking TAFIIS.

The general transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and a set of TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs). In vitro, TAFIIs are required for activated transcription, and have been proposed to be obligatory targets of transcriptional activator proteins (activators)2. The function of TAFIIs has not been investigated systematically in vivo. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae TAFII complex (yTAFII complex) has been identified that shares functional and structural similarities with higher eukaryotic TFIID. In particular, most yTAFIIs are the homologue of a higher eukaryotic TAFII. Here we report that inactivation or depletion of six different yTAFIIs, including the core yTAFII, that contacts TBP, does not compromise transcriptional activation. We conclude that in vivo, activated transcription of many genes can occur in the absence of functional yTAFIIS, and that in these instances another transcription component(s) must be the target of the activator.
