Cdc48p is required for the cell cycle commitment point at Start via degradation of the G1-CDK inhibitor Far1p.

The budding yeast Cdc48p and its mammalian homologue p97 are involved in many important cellular activities. Because previous cdc48 mutants have exclusive G2/M arrest, Cdc48p was thought to play an essential role only during mitosis. We found that Cdc48p is required for the execution of Start (a yeast cell cycle commitment point equivalent to the restriction point in mammalian cells) in both a normal mitotic cell cycle and cell cycle reentry after mating pheromone withdrawal through degradation of the G1-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Far1p. Our work is the first to uncover novel roles of Cdc48p as a critical cell cycle regulator in G1, and to shed new light on cell cycle regulation of Far1p, which is the first cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor shown to be a substrate of an essential proteolysis event mediated by Cdc48p.
