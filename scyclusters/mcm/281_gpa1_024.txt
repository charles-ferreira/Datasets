Identification of the mgc1 mutation which affects mating-pheromone-induced morphogenesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergo morphogenesis in response to the mating pheromones a- and alpha-factors. The 'shmoo' morphology involves localized cell surface projection formation and cytoskeleton protein synthesis. This polarization is presumed to be a prelude to mating between mating partners with opposite mating types, a and alpha. To identify genes involved in pheromone-induced morphogenesis, a system in which a gpa1 fus3 double mutant was used as a parent strain was developed, and mutants which showed altered morphogenesis in response to mating pheromone were identified. The mutation was designated mgc1 for morphogenesis control by mating pheromones. The mgc1 mutant arrested cell division in response to alpha-factor and mated with cells of the opposite mating type, but did not form a typical projection in response to pheromones.
