Functional domains of Pho81p, an inhibitor of Pho85p protein kinase, in the transduction pathway of Pi signals in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The PHO81 gene is thought to encode an inhibitor of the negative regulators (Pho80p and Pho85p) in the phosphatase (PHO) regulon. Transcription of PHO81 is regulated by Pi signals through the same PHO regulatory system. Elimination of the PHO81 promoter or its substitution by the GAL1 promoter revealed that stimulation of the PHO regulatory system requires both increased transcription of PHO81 and a Pi starvation signal. The predicted Pho81p protein contains 1,179 amino acids (aa) and has six repeats of an ankyrin-like sequence in its central region. The minimum amino acid sequence required for Pho81p function was narrowed down to a 141-aa segment (aa 584 to 724), which contains the fifth and sixth repeats of the ankyrin-like motif. The third to sixth repeats of the ankyrin-like motif of Pho81p have significant similarities to that of p16INK4, which inhibits activity of the human cyclin D-CDK4 kinase complex. Deletion analyses revealed that the N- and C-terminal regions of Pho81p behave as negative and positive regulatory domains, respectively, for the minimal 141-aa region. The negative regulatory activity of the N-terminal domain was antagonized by a C-terminal segment of Pho81p supplied in trans. All four known classes of PHO81c mutations that show repressible acid phosphatase activity in high-Pi medium affect the N-terminal half of Pho81p. An in vitro assay showed that a glutathione S-transferase-Pho81p fusion protein inhibits the Pho85p protein kinase. Association of Pho81p with Pho85p or with the Pho80p-Pho85p complex was demonstrated by the two-hybrid system.
