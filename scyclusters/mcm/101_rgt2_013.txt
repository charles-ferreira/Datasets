Glucose depletion rapidly inhibits translation initiation in yeast.

Glucose performs key functions as a signaling molecule in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Glucose depletion is known to regulate gene expression via pathways that lead to derepression of genes at the transcriptional level. In this study, we have investigated the effect of glucose depletion on protein synthesis. We discovered that glucose withdrawal from the growth medium led to a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis and that this effect was readily reversed upon readdition of glucose. Neither the inhibition nor the reactivation of translation required new transcription. This inhibition also did not require activation of the amino acid starvation pathway or inactivation of the TOR kinase pathway. However, mutants in the glucose repression (reg1, glc7, hxk2, and ssn6), hexose transporter induction (snf3 rgt2), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (tpk1(w) and tpk2(w)) pathways were resistant to the inhibitory effects of glucose withdrawal on translation. These findings highlight the intimate connection between the nutrient status of the cell and its translational capacity. They also help to define a new area of posttranscriptional regulation in yeast.
