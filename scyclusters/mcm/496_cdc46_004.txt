Reduced expression of pax-3 is associated with overexpression of cdc46 in the mouse embryo.

CDC46/MCM5 encodes a protein that is highly conserved among yeast, plants, and animals. It is found in a complex which exhibits DNA replication licensing activity, which is proposed to regulate the synthesis of DNA once and only once per cell cycle. In yeast, loss of function mutations of CDC46/MCM5 decrease DNA synthesis. Very little is known about the regulation of CDC46/MCM5 in any species. We report here that, in the mouse embryo, expression of cdc46 is increased in unfused portions of the neural tube when the gene encoding the transcription factor, Pax-3, is either nonfunctional or underexpressed. These results were observed both in embryos of diabetic mice, which we have previously shown express significantly reduced levels of Pax-3 mRNA, and in Splotch embryos, which carry loss of function Pax-3 alleles. This indicates that expression of cdc46 is negatively regulated as part of a Pax-3-dependent pathway. Since cdc46 appears to regulate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, it is possible that its overexpression is involved in defective embryonic development that is associated with loss of Pax-3 function.
