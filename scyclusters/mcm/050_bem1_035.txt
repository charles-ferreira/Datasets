Nucleotide sequence analysis of an 11.7 kb fragment of yeast chromosome II including BEM1, a new gene of the WD-40 repeat family and a new member of the KRE2/MNT1 family.

This paper reports the DNA sequence and analysis of an 11.7 kb segment localized on the right arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome II. This fragment contains one incomplete and five long and non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) designated from centromere to telomere-proximal side as: YBR1406, 1409, 1410, 1411, 1412 and 1413. YBR1406 corresponds to the 5' end to PG11 encoding phosphoglucoisomerase. YBR1410 encodes a polypeptide of 798 amino acids whose C terminus contains five repeats (WD-40 repeat) similar to those found in the beta-subunits of G proteins and different yeast proteins such as Tup1, Prp4 and Cdc4. The higher similarity score is obtained with dTAFII80, a component of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional complex TFIID. YBR1411 encodes a polypeptide of 464 amino acids which belongs to the family of alpha-mannosyltransferases: KRE2/MNT1, KTR1, KTR2, YUR1 and the product of previously sequenced ORF YBR1445. YBR1412 corresponds to BEM1. The two ORFs, YBR1409 and YBR1413, which do not exhibit significant similarity with any known coding sequences, define new genes.
