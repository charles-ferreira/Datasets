SED1 gene length and sequence polymorphisms in feral strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The SED1 gene (YDR077W), coding for the major cell wall glycoprotein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae stationary-phase cells, contains two blocks of tandem repeat units located within two distinct regions of the nucleotide sequence. A PCR survey of the SED1 open reading frames (ORFs) of 186 previously uncharacterized grape must isolates of S. cerevisiae yielded 13 PCR profiles arising from different combinations of seven SED1 length variants in individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the gene. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of a group of representatives of each of the seven length variants with those of S288C and the type strain, CBS1171, unequivocally identified them as SED1 alleles and provided evidence for the presence of two minisatellite-like sequences, variable in length, within the ORF of an S. cerevisiae gene. The segregation analyses of the SED1 length variants and other genetic markers in 13 isolates representative of each PCR profile suggested that molecular mechanisms involved in minisatellite expansion and contraction may be responsible for SED1 heterozygosities within a population of homothallic must isolates of S. cerevisiae.
