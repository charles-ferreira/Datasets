A novel zinc finger is required for Mcm10 homocomplex assembly.

Mcm10 is a DNA replication factor that interacts with multiple subunits of the MCM2-7 hexameric complex. We report here that Mcm10 self-interacts and assembles into large homocomplexes (approximately 800 kDa). A conserved domain of 210 amino acid residues is sufficient for mediating self-interaction and complex assembly. A novel zinc finger within the conserved domain, CX10CX11CX2H, is essential for the homocomplex formation. Mutant alleles with amino acid substitutions at conserved cysteines and histidine in the zinc finger fail to assemble homocomplexes. A defect in homocomplex assembly correlates with defects in DNA replication and cell growth in the mutants. These observations suggest that homocomplex assembly is essential for Mcm10 function. Multisubunit Mcm10 homocomplexes may provide the structural basis for Mcm10 to interact with multiple subunits of the MCM2-7 hexamer.
