Activation of Ste20 by Nef from human immunodeficiency virus induces cytoskeletal rearrangements and downstream effector functions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The negative factor (Nef) from human and simian immunodeficiency viruses is important for the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Among other targets, it activates the Nef-associated kinase, which is related to the p21-activated kinase. In this study, we demonstrate that Nef activates Ste20, the homolog of p21-activated kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nef binds to the adaptor proteins Bem1 and Ste20 via its proline-rich (PXXP) and diarginine (RR) motifs, respectively. These interactions induce the mitogen-activated protein kinase and increase the rates of budding, sizes of cells, and patterns of mating projections. These effects of Nef depend on the small GTPase Cdc42 and guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24. Thus, studies in S. cerevisiae identified specific interactions between Nef and cellular proteins and their associated signaling cascade. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.
