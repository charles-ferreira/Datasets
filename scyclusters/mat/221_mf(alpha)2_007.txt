Biologically significant conformation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor.

The conformation of the tridecapeptide alpha-factor of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was examined in both solution and in the presence of lipid vesicles. CD, differential scanning calorimetry, and phosphorus nmr all indicate that this mating pheromone interacts with lipid vesicles. In both aqueous and organic solution the alpha-factor is a flexible molecule that exhibits features of a type II beta-turn spanning the center of the peptide. Two-dimensional Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy gives evidence that the beta-turn is stabilized on interaction of the peptide with lipid vesicles. Our current belief is that the beta-turn may play an important role in the biologically active conformation of the alpha-factor.
