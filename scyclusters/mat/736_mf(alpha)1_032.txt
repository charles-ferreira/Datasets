Genetic manipulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by use of the LYS2 gene.

The structural gene for alpha-aminoadipate reductase (LYS2) was isolated from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA library by complementation of a lys2 mutant. Both genetic and biochemical criteria confirmed that the DNA obtained corresponds to the LYS2 locus on chromosome II. Subcloning and deletion analysis showed that a functional LYS2 gene is contained within a 4.6-kilobase (kb) EcoRI-HindIII fragment of the original insert, and the slightly larger EcoRI-ClaI segment (4.8 kb) was used to construct a series of cloning vehicles, including integrating, episomal, replicative, and centromeric vectors. The cloned DNA was also used to generate a genomic deletion that lacks all LYS2 coding sequences on chromosome II. The level of the LYS2 transcript (4.2 kb) was 10-fold higher in cells grown on minimal medium than in cells grown on complete medium and was not repressed by the presence of lysine alone. Gene disruption, gene replacement, and promoter analysis of the major alpha-factor structural gene (MF alpha 1) were performed to illustrate the utility of the LYS2 gene for the genetic manipulation of yeasts. Because all fungi synthesize lysine via the alpha-aminoadipate pathway, the techniques developed here for using the S. cerevisiae LYS2 gene should be directly applicable to other fungal systems.
