A novel yeast secretion vector utilizing secretion signal of killer toxin encoded on the yeast linear DNA plasmid pGKL1.

The NH2-terminal signal region comprising of approximately 70% length of the prepro-sequence of the pGKL killer precursor protein was found to direct an efficient secretion of the mouse alpha-amylase into the culture medium of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The alpha-amylase molecule secreted into the culture medium was identified by both immuno-blotting and assay of the enzyme activity. The amount of alpha-amylase secreted via the killer toxin signal was comparable to that directed by the leader sequence of mating factor alpha. The secretion of alpha-amylase using the killer toxin signal was blocked at 37C but not at 25C in sec18-1 host, indicating that alpha-amylase is exported through the normal secretion pathway of S. cerevisiae.
