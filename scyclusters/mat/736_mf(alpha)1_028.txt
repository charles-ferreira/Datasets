Single-amino-acid substitutions within the signal sequence of yeast prepro-alpha-factor affect membrane translocation.

We used a genetic approach to identify point mutations in the signal sequence of a secreted eucaryotic protein, yeast alpha-factor. Signal sequence mutants were obtained by selecting for cells that partially mistargeted into mitochondria a fusion protein consisting of the alpha-factor signal sequence fused to the mature portion of an imported mitochondrial protein (Cox IV). The mutations resulted in replacement of a residue in the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence with either a hydrophilic amino acid or a proline. After reassembly into an intact alpha-factor gene, the substitutions were found to decrease up to 50-fold the rate of translocation of prepro-alpha-factor across microsomal membranes in vitro. Two of three mutants tested produced lower steady-state levels of alpha-factor in intact yeast cells, although the magnitude of the effect was less than that in the cell-free system.
