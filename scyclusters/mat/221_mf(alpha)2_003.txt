Essential role for induced Ca2+ influx followed by [Ca2+]i rise in maintaining viability of yeast cells late in the mating pheromone response pathway. A study of [Ca2+]i in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with imaging of fura-2.

We established an experimental system for measuring the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells using fura-2 as a Ca2(+)-specific probe in conjunction with digital image processing and examined changes in [Ca2+]i in response to alpha-factor in single cells of a mating type. The addition of alpha-factor to a cells raised [Ca2+]i to several hundred nanomolar in the cells from a basal level of approximately 100 nM, simultaneous with the induction of Ca2+ influx. When the cells were incubated with alpha-factor in a Ca2(+)-deficient medium, Ca2+ influx was greatly reduced, and the rise in [Ca2+]i was not detected. This indicates that the alpha-factor-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is generated by Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane and not by release from internal stores. In the Ca2(+)-deficient medium, a cells died specifically after they had changed into cells with one projection on the cell surface. This indicates that the rise in [Ca2+]i is essential for the late response to alpha-factor. The duration of Ca2+ requirement for maintaining viability was limited to this stage, and the earlier and later stages were not affected by Ca2+ deprivation. Mating between a and alpha mating type cells was impaired in this medium due to cell death at and before the stage of conjugation. These findings are the first evidence for an essential role for mobilized Ca2+ in the yeast life cycle.
