Identification and characterization of novel somatostatin antagonists.

The study of the five somatostatin receptor subtypes (SSTx, where x is the subtype number) has been hampered by the lack of high affinity antagonists. Potent and selective antagonists would increase our understanding of SST structure, function, and regulation. In this study, the identification of novel disulfide-linked cyclic octapeptide antagonists of somatostatin is described. The antagonists contain a core structure of a DL-cysteine pair at positions 2 and 7 of the peptides. Substitution of a D-cysteine at position 2 with an L-cysteine converts the full antagonist into a full agonist. All somatostatin receptor subtypes are coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The functional properties of these peptides have been determined in radioligand binding assays, in functional coupling of the SST2 subtype to yeast pheromone response pathway, and in cAMP accumulations. One peptide antagonist [Ac-4-NO2-Phe-c(D-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys)-D-Tyr-NH2] displays a binding affinity to SST2 comparable with that observed for the native hormone (Ki = 0.2 nM) and reverses somatostatin-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation in rat somatomammotroph GH4C1 cells, cells transfected with the SST2 and SST5 subtypes, as well as somatostatin-stimulated growth of yeast cells expressing the SST2 subtype. This class of somatostatin antagonists, which are the first to be described, should be useful for determination of somatostatin's diverse functions in vivo and in vitro.
