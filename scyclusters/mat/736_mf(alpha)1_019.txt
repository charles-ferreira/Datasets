Glycosylation and structure of the yeast MF alpha 1 alpha-factor precursor is important for efficient transport through the secretory pathway.

The MF alpha 1 gene encodes a precursor, prepro-alpha-factor, that undergoes several proteolytic processing steps within the classical secretory pathway to produce the mature peptide pheromone, alpha-factor. To investigate the role of structural features of the MF alpha 1 precursor in alpha-factor production, we analyzed the effect of mf alpha 1 mutations that alter precursor structure in a number of ways. These mutations resulted in decreased alpha-factor secretion and intracellular accumulation of pro-alpha-factor. With the exception of the mutant lacking all three N glycosylation sites, the pro-alpha-factor forms that accumulated were core glycosylated but had not yet undergone the addition of outer chain carbohydrate. The delay, therefore, occurred at a step prior to the first proteolytic processing step involved in maturation of the precursor and was probably due to inefficient endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport. Elimination of all three N-glycosylation sites caused a delay in disappearance of intracellular precursor, and alpha-factor secretion was also slowed. These data indicate that N glycosylation is important but not essential for transport of the precursor through the secretory pathway. The decreased alpha-factor secretion and increased precursor accumulation seen with many different structural changes of pro-alpha-factor indicate that the secretory pathway is extremely sensitive to changes in precursor structure. This sensitivity could cause inefficient secretion of heterologous proteins and hybrids between MF alpha 1 and heterologous proteins in yeast cells.
