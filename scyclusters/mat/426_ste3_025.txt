Evidence the yeast STE3 gene encodes a receptor for the peptide pheromone a factor: gene sequence and implications for the structure of the presumed receptor.

Haploid yeast cells of the a mating type secrete a peptide pheromone, a factor, which acts on cells of the alpha mating type to prepare them for conjugation. We show that the STE3 gene, which is required for mating only by alpha cells and is transcribed only in alpha cells, likely encodes a cell-surface receptor for a factor. This view is based on three findings. First, wild-type Ste3 product is required for response to the pheromone: mutants with any one of five different ste3 mutations are unresponsive to a factor. Second, a hybrid Ste3-beta-galactosidase protein encoded by a STE3-lacZ gene fusion fractionates to the particulate fraction of yeast cell extracts, suggesting that Ste3 is a membrane protein. Finally, the DNA sequence of STE3, which we report here, encodes a protein of 470 amino acid residues that contains seven distinct hydrophobic segments of sufficient length to span a lipid bilayer.
