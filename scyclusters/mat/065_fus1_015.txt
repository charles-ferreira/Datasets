Cloning and characterisation of PGA1 and PGA2: two G protein alpha-subunits from pea that promote growth in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

We report here on the cloning and characterization of two G protein alpha-subunits from pea: PGA1 and PGA2. Based on DNA gel blot analysis, PGA1 and PGA2 are the only Galpha homologous sequences in pea. RT-PCR analysis reveals that PGA1 and PGA2 transcripts are present in a variety of adult pea tissues. However, PGA2 mRNA is consistently detected at a lower level than PGA1 and demonstrates some degree of tissue specificity relative to PGA1. In the apical bud of pea seedlings, PGA1 and PGA2 transcripts decrease in response to 24 h of white light following growth for 6 days in darkness. The G protein mediated, yeast mating pathway was used to analyse the function of PGA1 and PGA2 in vivo. PGA1 downregulates the mating pathway, but through a mechanism that is independent of Gbetagamma sequestration. Unexpectedly, both PGA1 and PGA2 promote growth through a mating pathway independent mechanism.
