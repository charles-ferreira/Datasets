A yeast replicative helicase, Dna2 helicase, interacts with yeast FEN-1 nuclease in carrying out its essential function.

We have recently described a new helicase, the Dna2 helicase, that is essential for yeast DNA replication. We now show that the yeast FEN-1 (yFEN-1) nuclease interacts genetically and biochemically with Dna2 helicase. FEN-1 is implicated in DNA replication and repair in yeast, and the mammalian homolog of yFEN-1 (DNase IV, FEN-1, or MF1) participates in Okazaki fragment maturation. Overproduction of yFEN-1, encoded by RAD27/RTH1, suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth of dna2-1 mutants. Overproduction of Dna2 suppresses the rad27/rth1 delta temperature-sensitive growth defect. dna2-1 rad27/rth1 delta double mutants are inviable, indicating that the mutations are synthetically lethal. The genetic interactions are likely due to direct physical interaction between the two proteins, since both epitope-tagged yFEN-1 and endogenous yFEN-1 coimmunopurify with tagged Dna2. The simplest interpretation of these data is that one of the roles of Dna2 helicase is associated with processing of Okazaki fragments.
