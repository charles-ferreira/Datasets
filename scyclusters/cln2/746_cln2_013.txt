Molecular evolution allows bypass of the requirement for activation loop phosphorylation of the Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase.

Many protein kinases are regulated by phosphorylation in the activation loop, which is required for enzymatic activity. Glutamic acid can substitute for phosphothreonine in some proteins activated by phosphorylation, but this substitution (T169E) at the site of activation loop phosphorylation in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) Cdc28p blocks biological function and protein kinase activity. Using cycles of error-prone DNA amplification followed by selection for successively higher levels of function, we identified mutant versions of Cdc28p-T169E with high biological activity. The enzymatic and biological activity of the mutant Cdc28p was essentially normally regulated by cyclin, and the mutants supported normal cell cycle progression and regulation. Therefore, it is not a requirement for control of the yeast cell cycle that Cdc28p be cyclically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. These CDC28 mutants allow viability in the absence of Cak1p, the essential kinase that phosphorylates Cdc28p-T169, demonstrating that T169 phosphorylation is the only essential function of Cak1p. Some growth defects remain in suppressed cak1 cdc28 strains carrying the mutant CDC28 genes, consistent with additional nonessential roles for CAK1.
