A localized GTPase exchange factor, Bud5, determines the orientation of division axes in yeast.

GTPases are widespread in directing cytoskeletal rearrangements and affecting cellular organization. How they do so is not well understood. Yeast cells divide by budding, which occurs in two spatially programmed patterns, axial or bipolar [1-3]. Cytoskeletal polarization to form a bud is governed by the Ras-like GTPase, Bud1/Rsr1, in response to cortical landmarks. Bud1 is uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane, so presumably its regulators, Bud5 GTPase exchange factor and Bud2 GTPase activating protein, impart spatial specificity to Bud1 action [4]. We examined the localizations of Bud5 and Bud2. Both Bud1 regulators associate with cortical landmarks designating former division sites. In haploids, Bud5 forms double rings that encircle the mother-bud neck and split upon cytokinesis so that each progeny cell inherits Bud5 at the axial division remnant. Recruitment of Bud5 into these structures depends on known axial landmark components. In cells undergoing bipolar budding, Bud5 associates with multiple sites, in response to the bipolar landmarks. Like Bud5, Bud2 associates with the axial division remnant, but rather than being inherited, Bud2 transiently associates with the remnant in late G1, before condensing into a patch at the incipient bud site. The relative timing of Bud5 and Bud2 localizations suggests that both regulators contribute to the spatially specific control of Bud1 GTPase.
