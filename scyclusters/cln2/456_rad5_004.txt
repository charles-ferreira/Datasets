Dissection of the functions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD6 postreplicative repair group in mutagenesis and UV sensitivity.

The RAD6 postreplicative repair group participates in various processes of DNA metabolism. To elucidate the contribution of RAD6 to starvation-associated mutagenesis, which occurs in nongrowing cells cultivated under selective conditions, we analyzed the phenotype of strains expressing various alleles of the RAD6 gene and single and multiple mutants of the RAD6, RAD5, RAD18, REV3, and MMS2 genes from the RAD6 repair group. Our results show that the RAD6 repair pathway is also active in starving cells and its contribution to starvation-associated mutagenesis is similar to that of spontaneous mutagenesis. Epistatic analysis based on both spontaneous and starvation-associated mutagenesis and UV sensitivity showed that the RAD6 repair group consists of distinct repair pathways of different relative importance requiring, besides the presence of Rad6, also either Rad18 or Rad5 or both. We postulate the existence of four pathways: (1) nonmutagenic Rad5/Rad6/Rad18, (2) mutagenic Rad5/Rad6 /Rev3, (3) mutagenic Rad6/Rad18/Rev3, and (4) Rad6/Rad18/Rad30. Furthermore, we show that the high mutation rate observed in rad6 mutants is caused by a mutator different from Rev3. From our data and data previously published, we suggest a role for Rad6 in DNA repair and mutagenesis and propose a model for the RAD6 postreplicative repair group.
