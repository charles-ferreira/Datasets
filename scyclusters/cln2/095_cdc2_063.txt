Characterization of the POL3 gene product from Schizosaccharomyces pombe indicates inter-species conservation of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta.

The Schizosaccharomyces pombe POL3 gene was isolated by sequence homology with a region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae POL3 gene, the only gene sequenced to date encoding the catalytic subunit of eukaryotic DNA polymerase delta. The fission yeast POL3 gene contains a 52 base-pair (bp) intron and encodes a 3600 bp transcript the 5'-end of which is located 32 bp upstream from the initiation codon. The polypeptides predicted from budding and fission yeast POL3 genes share 52% of conserved amino acid residues and have a 60% identical central region. This structural conservation of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerases delta is probably related to functional constraints. A portion of the most conserved region was used to raise antibodies against an S. pombe polymerase delta/beta-galactosidase fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified antibodies recognized a 123,000 Da protein in S. pombe wild-type cell extracts and inhibited an aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerase activity that was distinct from DNA polymerase alpha. The antibodies also detected a 140,000 Da protein in extracts from different proliferating mammalian cells, indicating that the catalytic subunits of DNA polymerase delta are highly conserved between yeast and higher eukaryotes.
