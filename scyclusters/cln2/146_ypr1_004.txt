Highly stereoselective reagents for beta-keto ester reductions by genetic engineering of baker's yeast.

While whole cells of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are a convenient biocatalytic reducing agent for a wide variety of carbonyl compounds, mixtures of stereoisomeric alcohols are often observed since the organism contains a large number of reductase enzymes with overlapping substrate specificities but differing stereoselectivities. We sought to improve the performance of baker's yeast for beta-keto ester reductions by using recombinant DNA techniques to alter the levels of three enzymes known to play important roles in these reactions (fatty acid synthase, Fasp; aldo-keto reductase, Ypr1p; alpha-acetoxy ketone reductase, Gre2p). A complete set of &quot;first-generation&quot; yeast strains that either lack or overexpress each of these three enzymes was created and tested for improvements in stereoselective reductions of a series of beta-keto esters. On the basis of these results, multiply modified (&quot;second-generation&quot;) strains were created that combined gene knockout and overexpression in single strains. In some cases, these additional modifications further improved the stereoselectivities of beta-keto ester reductions, thereby making several beta-hydroxy ester building blocks readily available by reactions that can be performed by nonspecialists. This work also revealed that additional yeast proteins participate in reducing beta-keto esters, and further progress using this strategy will require either additional genetic manipulations or the expression of yeast reductases in hosts that lack enzymes with overlapping substrate specificity.
