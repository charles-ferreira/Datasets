The yeast RAD7 and RAD16 genes are required for postincision events during nucleotide excision repair. In vitro and in vivo studies with rad7 and rad16 mutants and purification of a Rad7/Rad16-containing protein complex.

In eukaryotes, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a complex reaction requiring multiple proteins. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two of these proteins, Rad7 and Rad16, are specifically involved in the removal of lesions from transcriptionally silent regions of the genome in vivo. Extracts prepared from rad7 or rad16 mutant cells are deficient, but not totally defective, in both oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis of damaged plasmid DNA. We show that these extracts are, however, fully proficient in the incision step of the NER reaction in vitro. Furthermore, using a cdc9 mutant to trap incision intermediates, we demonstrate that rad7 and rad16 mutants are proficient in NER-dependent DNA incision in vivo. A purified protein complex containing both Rad7 and Rad16 proteins complements the oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis defects in rad7 and rad16 mutant extracts. We conclude that the products of the RAD7 and RAD16 genes are involved in a postincision event(s) during NER in yeast.
