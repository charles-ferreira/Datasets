Removal of one nonhomologous DNA end during gene conversion by a RAD1- and MSH2-independent pathway.

Repair of a double-strand break (DSB) by homologous recombination depends on the invasion of a 3'-ended strand into an intact template sequence to initiate new DNA synthesis. When the end of the invading DNA is not homologous to the donor, the nonhomologous sequences must be removed before new synthesis can begin. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the removal of these ends depends on both the nucleotide excision repair endonuclease Rad1p/Rad10p and the mismatch repair proteins Msh2p/Msh3p. In rad1 or msh2 mutants, when both ends of the DSB have nonhomologous ends, repair is reduced approximately 90-fold compared to a plasmid with perfect ends; however, with only one nonhomologous end, repair is reduced on average only 5-fold. These results suggest that yeast has an alternative, but less efficient, way to remove a nonhomologous tail from the second end participating in gene conversion. When the removal of one nonhomologous end is impaired in rad1 and msh2 mutants, there is also a 1-hr delay in the appearance of crossover products of gene conversion, compared to noncrossovers. We interpret these results in terms of the formation and resolution of alternative intermediates of a synthesis-dependent strand annealing mechanism.
