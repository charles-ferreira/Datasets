Protein-protein interactions within an E2-RING finger complex. Implications for ubiquitin-dependent DNA damage repair.

The RING finger protein RAD5 interacts and cooperates with the UBC13-MMS2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in postreplication DNA damage repair in yeast. Previous observations implied that the function of UBC13 and MMS2 is dependent on the presence of RAD5, suggesting that the RING finger protein might act as a ubiquitin-protein ligase specific for the UBC13-MMS2 complex. In support of this notion it is shown here that the contact surfaces between the RAD5 RING domain and UBC13 correspond to those found in other pairs of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin-protein ligases. Mutations that compromise the protein-protein interactions either between the RING domain and UBC13 or within the UBC13-MMS2 dimer were found to have variable effects on repair activity in vivo that strongly depended on the expression levels of the corresponding mutants. Quantitative analysis of the affinity and kinetics of the UBC13-MMS2 interaction suggests a highly dynamic association model in which compromised mutual interactions result in phenotypic effects only under conditions where protein levels become limiting. Finally, this study demonstrates that beyond its cooperation with the UBC13-MMS2 dimer, RAD5 must have an additional role in DNA damage repair independent of its RING finger domain.
