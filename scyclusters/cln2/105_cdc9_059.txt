Incision and postincision steps of pyrimidine dimer removal in excision-defective mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

cdc9, a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in polynucleotide deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ligase activity, accumulates low-molecular-weight DNA fragments (as measured by sedimentation of DNA in alkaline sucrose gradients) at the nonpermissive temperature after irradiation with ultraviolet light. This phenotype of cdc9 is a sensitive indicator of successful incision during excision repair of dimers. In strains containing excision-defective mutations in any of nine genes in combination with the cdc9 mutation, the absence of low-molecular-weight DNA at the nonpermissive temperature after ultraviolet treatment suggests that these mutants are incision defective, whereas the presence of low-molecular-weight DNA indicates that the mutants are defective in a step after incision. With rad1, rad2, rad3, rad4, and rad10 mutants, the molecular weight of the DNA remained unchanged after ultraviolet irradiation and incubation at the restrictive temperature, despite the presence of the cdc9 mutation; these mutants are therefore incision defective. Low-molecular-weight DNA was observed in rad14 cdc9 and rad16 cdc9 strains. With the rad16 strain, the accumulation of low-molecular-weight DNA correlated with the amount of excision taking place, whereas in the rad14 mutant strain, no evidence of dimer removal was obtained. Therefore, rad14 is likely to be defective in a step after incision.
