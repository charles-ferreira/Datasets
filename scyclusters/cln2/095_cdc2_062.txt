Cloning and sequencing of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae SEC1 gene localized on chromosome IV.

The SEC1 gene of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned by complementing the temperature-sensitive mutation of sec1-1 at 37 degrees C, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. SEC1 is a single copy gene and encodes a protein of 724 amino acids and 83,490 daltons with a predicted pI value of 6.11. Hydrophobicity plotting showed no clearly hydrophobic regions suggesting a soluble nature for the protein. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed no obvious homologies with the proteins in the SWISSPROT databank. Two consensus sequence for the cdc2 encoded protein kinase recognition site were revealed within Sec1p. The codon usage suggests a low expression level for SEC1. The 5' non-translated region contains two TATA-like sequences at -52 and -215 nucleotides from the translation start site. Two potential regulatory sequences for DNA binding proteins were found in the non-coding 5' region: a HAP2/HAP3 consensus recognition sequence at nucleotide-154 and a BAF1 consensus recognition sequence at nucleotide-136. The SEC1 specific probe detected a 2400 nucleotides long transcript, which was in reasonable agreement with the 2172 nucleotides long open reading frame.
