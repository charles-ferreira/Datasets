The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msh2 mismatch repair protein localizes to recombination intermediates in vivo.

Mismatch repair proteins act during double-strand break repair (DSBR) to correct mismatches in heteroduplex DNA, to suppress recombination between divergent sequences, and to promote removal of nonhomologous DNA at DSB ends. We investigated yeast Msh2p association with recombination intermediates in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation. During DSBR involving nonhomologous ends, Msh2p localized strongly to recipient and donor sequences. Localization required Msh3p and was greatly reduced in rad50delta strains. Minimal localization of Msh2p was observed during fully homologous repair, but this was increased in rad52delta strains. These findings argue that Msh2p-Msh3p associates with intermediates early in DSBR to participate in the rejection of homeologous pairing and to stabilize nonhomologous tails for cleavage by Rad1p-Rad10p endonuclease.
