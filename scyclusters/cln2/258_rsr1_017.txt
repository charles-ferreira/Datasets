Rsr1 and Rap1 GTPases are activated by the same GTPase-activating protein and require threonine 65 for their activation.

The Rsr1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to be essential for bud site selection (Bender, A., and Pringle, J. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 9976-9980). This protein of 272 amino acids shares approximately 50% sequence identity with both Ras and Rap GTPases. However, neither GTP binding nor GTPase activity of the Rsr1 protein has been reported. The Rsr1 protein shares with human Rap1 GTPases the four specific motifs, i.e. Gly-12, residues 32-40, Ala-59, and residues 64-70, that are required for GAP3-dependent activation of the Rap1 GTPases. In this paper we demonstrate that the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rsr1 protein is stimulated by GAP3 purified from bovine brain cytosol. The Rsr1 GTPase is not activated by either GAP1 or GAP2 which are specific for the Ras and Rho GTPases, respectively. Thus, it appears that the Rsr1 GTPase is a new member of the Rap1 GTPase family. Replacement of Gly-12 by Val in the Rsr1 GTPase completely abolishes the GAP3-dependent activation. The chimeric GTPases, Ras(1-60)/Rsr1(61-168) and Rsr1(1-65)/Ras(66-189), are activated by GAP3 but not by GAP1. Replacement of Thr-65 by Ser in the latter chimeric GTPase completely abolishes the GAP3-dependent activation, indicating that Thr-65 is required for distinguishing GAP3 from GAP1. We have previously shown that Gln-61 and Ser-65 are sufficient to determine the GAP1 specificity. Replacement of Thr-35 by Ala in the common effector domain (residues 32-40) of the chimeric Ras/Rsr1 GTPases completely abolishes GAP3-dependent activation.
