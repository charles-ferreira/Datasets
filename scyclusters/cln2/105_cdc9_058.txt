Spontaneous mitotic recombination in mms8-1, an allele of the CDC9 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The methyl methane sulfonate (MMS)-sensitive mutation mms8-1 increases the rate of spontaneous mitotic intragenic recombination at five heteroallelic loci on three chromosomes. Complementation, segregation, and mapping studies indicate that mms8-1 is allelic to cdc9, known to be defective in deoxyribonucleic acid ligase. Both mms8-1 and cdc9 mutants are lethal in combination with the recombination-defective mutant rad52-1. Genetic analysis of spontaneous red/white sectors in an ade2-1/ade2-1 ade5/+ mms8-1/mms8-1 strain shows nonreciprocal recombinational events involving long chromosome segments. We also observe greater than expected rates of simultaneous recombination at loci on different chromosomes in both wild-type and mms8-1 mutants.
