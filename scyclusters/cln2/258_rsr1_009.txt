Identification and sequence analysis of a rap gene from the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum.

A member of the ras gene superfamily, belonging to the rap family and designated Pprap1, was isolated from a cDNA library from the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum by plaque hybridization in combination with 5'-RACE. The assembled nucleotide sequence of Pprap1 (1062 bp) has an open reading frame coding for a protein of 188 amino acids of a calculated M(r) of 21035. This protein exhibits: (i) a highly conserved GTP binding domain containing a putative effector domain, with the threonine-for-glutamine substitution characteristic of rap proteins, (ii) a hypervariable domain, and (iii) the CAAX motif. Analysis of the C-terminal amino acid sequence of Pprap1 shows that it presumably undergoes geranylgeranylation but is not palmitoylated; however, it contains a lysine-rich domain which might serve as the second membrane localization signal. Pprap1 exhibits significantly high amino acid homology within the GTP binding domain with its homologues: Ddrap1 from Dictyostelium discoideum (92%) and human Rap1A (83%), and relatively low homology (59%) with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue, RSR1. It has also 59% and 61% homology with the P. polycephalum Ppras1 and Ppras2 proteins, respectively. This gene is the third member of the ras gene superfamily identified in P. polycephalum so far.
