Thymidine utilization by tut mutants and facile cloning of mutant alleles by plasmid conversion in S. cerevisiae.

Plasmid pJM81 contains a Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene that is expressed in yeast. Cells containing the plasmid utilize thymidine (TdR) and the analogue 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) for specific incorporation into DNA. TdR auxotrophs, harboring plasmid pJM81 and a mutation in the yeast gene TMP1 require high concentrations of TdR (300 micrograms/ml) to support normal growth rates and the wild-type mitochondrial genome (rho+) cannot be maintained. We have identified a yeast gene, TUT1, in which recessive mutations allow efficient utilization of lower concentrations of TdR. Strains containing the mutations tmp1 and tut1, as well as plasmid pJM81, form colonies at 2 micrograms/ml TdR, grow at nearly normal rates and maintain the rho+ genome at 50 micrograms/ml TdR. These strains can be used to radiolabel DNA specifically and to synchronize DNA replication by TdR starvation. In addition, the substitution of BUdR for TdR allows the selective killing of DNA-synthesizing cells by 310-nm irradiation and allows the separation of replicated and unreplicated forms of DNA by CsCl equilibrium density banding. We also describe a unique, generally applicable system for cloning mutant alleles that exploits the fact that Tk+ yeast cells are sensitive to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) and that gene conversions can occur between a yeast chromosome and a TK-containing plasmid.
