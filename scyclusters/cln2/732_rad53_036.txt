S-phase DNA damage checkpoint in budding yeast.

Eukaryotic cells must be able to coordinate DNA repair, replication and cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage. A failure to activate the checkpoints which delay the cell cycle in response to internal and external cues and to repair the DNA lesions results in an increase in genetic instability and cancer predisposition. The use of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been invaluable in isolating many of the genes required for the DNA damage response, although the molecular mechanisms which couple this regulatory pathway to different DNA transactions are still largely unknown. In analogy with prokaryotes, we propose that DNA strand breaks, caused by genotoxic agents or by replication-related lesions, trigger a replication coupled repair mechanism, dependent upon recombination, which is induced by the checkpoint acting during S-phase.
