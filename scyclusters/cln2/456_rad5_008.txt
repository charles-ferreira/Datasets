The RAD5 gene product is involved in the avoidance of non-homologous end-joining of DNA double strand breaks in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In wild-type yeast, the repair of a 169 bp double-strand gap induced by the restriction enzymes ApaI and NcoI in the URA3gene of the shuttle vector YpJA18 occurs with high fidelity according to the homologous chromosomal sequence. In contrast, only 25% of the cells of rad5-7 and rad5 Delta mutants perform correct gap repair. As has been proven by sequencing of the junction sites, the remaining cells recircularise the gapped plasmids by joining of the non-compatible, non-homologous ends. Thus, regarding the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, the rad5 mutants behave like mammalian cells rather than budding yeast. The majority of the end joined plasmids miss either one or both of the 3'and 5'protruding single-strands of the restriction ends completely and have undergone blunt-end ligation accompanied by fill-in DNA synthesis. These results imply an important role for the Rad5 protein (Rad5p) in the protection of protruding single-strand ends and for the avoidance of non-homologous end joining during repair of double-strand gaps in budding yeast. Alternatively, the Rad5p may be an accessory factor increasing the efficiency of homologous recombination in yeast, however, the molecular mechanism of Rad5p function requires further investigation.
