Fission yeast cut3 and cut14, members of a ubiquitous protein family, are required for chromosome condensation and segregation in mitosis.

Fission yeast temperature-sensitive mutants cut3-477 and cut14-208 fail to condense chromosomes but small portions of the chromosomes can separate along the spindle during mitosis, producing phi-shaped chromosomes. Septation and cell division occur in the absence of normal nuclear division, causing the cut phenotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that the contraction of the chromosome arm during mitosis was defective. Mutant chromosomes are apparently not rigid enough to be transported poleward by the spindle. Loss of the cut3 protein by gene disruption fails to maintain the nuclear chromatin architecture even in interphase. Both cut3 and cut14 proteins contain a putative nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)-binding domain and belong to the same ubiquitous protein family which includes the budding yeast Smc1 protein. The cut3 mutant was suppressed by an increase in the cut14+ gene dosage. The cut3 protein, having the highest similarity to the mouse protein, is localized in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. Plasmids carrying the DNA topoisomerase I gene partly suppressed the temperature sensitive phenotype of cut3-477, suggesting that the cut3 protein might be involved in chromosome DNA topology.
