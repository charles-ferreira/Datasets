The 70 kDa subunit of replication protein A is required for the G1/S and intra-S DNA damage checkpoints in budding yeast.

The rfa1-M2 and rfa1-M4 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants, which are altered in the 70 kDa subunit of replication protein A (RPA) and sensitive to UV and methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), have been analyzed for possible checkpoint defects. The G1/S and intra-S DNA damage checkpoints are defective in the rfa1-M2 mutant, since rfa1-M2 cells fail to properly delay cell cycle progression in response to UV irradiation in G1 and MMS treatment during S phase. Conversely, the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint and the S/M checkpoint are proficient in rfa1-M2 cells and all the checkpoints tested are functional in the rfa1-M4 mutant. Preventing S phase entry by alpha-factor treatment after UV irradiation in G1 does not change rfa1-M4 cell lethality, while it allows partial recovery of rfa1-M2 cell viability. Therefore, the hypersensitivity to UV and MMS treatments observed in the rfa1-M4 mutant might only be due to impairment of RPA function in DNA repair, while the rfa1-M2 mutation seems to affect both the DNA repair and checkpoint functions of Rpa70.
