Sequencing analysis of a 24.7 kb fragment of yeast chromosome XIV identifies six known genes, a new member of the hexose transporter family and ten new open reading frames.

The DNA sequence of a 24.7 kb region covering the left arm of chromosome XIV from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined. This region contains 17 open reading frames (ORFs) which code for proteins of more than 100 amino acids. Five ORFs correspond to the KRE1, ATP11, DAL82, RFA2 and MCK1 loci, described previously. Two ORFs present high similarity to known proteins: NO345 with the hexose transporter family, and NO351 with the yeast chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase enzyme encoded by PHA2. Six ORFs show limited similarity with known proteins or some specific features: NO339 presents 11 potential transmembrane domains. NO343, which is internal to NO345, presents a putative signal sequence and a potential transmembrane domain. NO348 shows similarity with YCW2, TUP1 and SEC13. NO364 reveals a signature for a pyridoxal-phosphate attachment site. Finally, NO384 and NO388 present a biased amino acid composition, being rich in Asn or Glu/Lys/Arg, respectively. Four other ORFs (NO342, NO376, NO381 and NO397) show no similarity to proteins within the databases screened.
