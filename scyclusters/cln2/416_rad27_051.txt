Sequence of a 10.7 kb segment of yeast chromosome XI identifies the APN1 and the BAF1 loci and reveals one tRNA gene and several new open reading frames including homologs to RAD2 and kinases.

We report here the DNA sequence of a segment of chromosome XI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae extending over 10.7 kb. The sequence was determined using a double-strand sequencing strategy adapted from the random-clone strategy. The segment contains seven non-overlapping long open reading frames, YKL500, 505, 510, 513, 516, 518 and 520 and one tRNA gene. YKL505 and YKL513 are two already sequenced genes, the BAF1/ABF1 and the APN1 genes, respectively. YKL510 exhibits a strong homology to the RAD2 protein and YKL516 is presumably a protein kinase.
