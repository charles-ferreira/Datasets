The yeast DNA polymerase I transcript is regulated in both the mitotic cell cycle and in meiosis and is also induced after DNA damage.

Using mitotic cultures synchronised by a feed-starve protocol or by elutriation, we have shown that the yeast DNA polymerase I gene is periodically expressed with its transcript increasing at least 100-fold in late G1 with a peak around the G1/S phase boundary. This is precisely the same interval of the cell cycle in which three other yeast DNA synthesis genes, CDC8, CDC9 and CDC21, have been found to be periodically expressed (White et al 1987. Expl. Cell. Res., in press). The polymerase I transcript is also regulated in meiosis, showing an overall fluctuation in level of some 20-fold, with a peak at about mid-S phase. In addition, following irradiation with 50J/m2 ultraviolet light, there was a 20-fold increase in the transcript, starting after 30 minutes and reaching a peak two hours later. These results indicate that DNA polymerase I is subject to a complex control and imply that it has a role in both DNA synthesis and DNA repair.
