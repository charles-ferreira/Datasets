Overproduction and functional analysis of DNA primase subunits from yeast and mouse.

Eukaryotic DNA primases are composed of two distinct subunits of 48-50 and 58-60 kDa. The amino acid sequences derived from the nucleotide sequences of the cloned genes are known only for the yeast and mouse polypeptides, and the extensive homology between the corresponding mouse and yeast subunits suggests conservation of functional domains. We were able to express in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the homologous and mouse primase-encoding genes under the control of both the constitutive ADH1 and the inducible GAL1 strong promoters, thus obtaining strains producing relevant amounts of the different polypeptides. In vivo complementation studies showed that neither one of the wild-type mouse primase-encoding genes was able to rescue the lethal or temperature-sensitive phenotype caused by mutations in the yeast PRI1 or PRI2 genes, indicating that these proteins, even if structurally and functionally very similar, might be involved in critical species-specific interactions during DNA replication.
