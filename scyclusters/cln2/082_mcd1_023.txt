NXP-1, a human protein related to Rad21/Scc1/Mcd1, is a component of the nuclear matrix.

Nuclear matrix is a complex intranuclear network supposed to be involved in the various nuclear functions. In order to identify the nuclear matrix proteins, we isolated a cDNA clone from a human placenta cDNA library. This clone was partially represented a known cDNA clone HA1237. HA1237 encoded a 631-amino-acid peptide, which we designated NXP-1. NXP-1 was related to yeast Rad21/Scc1/Mcd1, Xenopus XRAD21, and mouse PW29, and identical with HR21spA isolated from a human testis cDNA library. We developed a polyclonal antibody to the purified NXP-1 bacterially expressed as a fusion protein with GST. Western blot analysis with anti-NXP-1 polyclonal antibody showed nuclear matrix localization of NXP-1 in HeLa cells. Indirect immunofluorescence staining also showed nuclear and nuclear matrix localization of the NXP-1. Results of in vitro binding assays employing nuclear matrix preparations indicated that the N-terminal region (16-128 amino acid) of NXP-1 has an important role in nuclear matrix distribution.
