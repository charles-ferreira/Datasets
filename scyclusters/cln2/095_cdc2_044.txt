Regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC7 function during the cell cycle.

The yeast Cdc7 function is required for the G1/S transition and is dependent on passage through START, a point controlled by the Cdc28/cdc2/p34 protein kinase. CDC7 encodes a protein kinase activity, and we now show that this kinase activity varies in the cell cycle but that protein levels appear to remain constant. We present several lines of evidence that periodic activation of CDC7 kinase is at least in part through phosphorylation. First, the kinase activity of the Cdc7 protein is destroyed by dephosphorylation of the protein in vitro with phosphatase. Second, Cdc7 protein is hypophosphorylated and inactive as a kinase in extracts of cells arrested at START but becomes active and maximally phosphorylated subsequent to passage through START. The phosphorylation pattern of Cdc7 protein is complex. Phosphopeptide mapping reveals four phosphopeptides in Cdc7 prepared from asynchronous yeast cells. Both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation in trans appear to contribute to this pattern. Autophosphorylation is shown to occur by using a thermolabile Cdc7 protein. A protein in yeast extracts can phosphorylate and activate Cdc7 protein made in Escherichia coli, and phosphorylation is thermolabile in cdc28 mutant extracts. Cdc7 protein carrying a serine to alanine change in the consensus recognition site for Cdc28 kinase shows an altered phosphopeptide map, suggesting that this site is important in determining the overall Cdc7 phosphorylation pattern.
