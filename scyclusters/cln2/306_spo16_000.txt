Genetic and molecular analysis of REC114, an early meiotic recombination gene in yeast.

Four new meiotic recombination genes were previously isolated by selecting for mutations that rescue the meiotic lethality of rad52 spo13 strains. One of these genes, REC114, is described here, and the data confirm that REC114 is a meiosis-specific recombination gene with no detectable function in mitosis. REC114 is located on chromosome XIII approximately 4.9 cM from CIN4. The nucleotide sequence reveals an open reading frame of 1262 bp, consensus intron splice sites close to the 3' end, and indicates that the second exon codes for only seven amino acids. In the promoter region, a URS1 consensus sequence (TGGGCGGCTA), identical to the URS1 found in the promoter of SPO16, is present 93 bp upstream of the translation start site. Northern-blot hybridization demonstrates that REC114 is transcribed only during meiosis and that it is not expressed in the absence of the IME1 gene product, even when IME2 is constitutively expressed.
