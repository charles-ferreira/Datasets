Mapping of early firing origins on a replication profile of budding yeast.

BACKGROUND: Understanding of the firing time determination of replication origins in the entire genome will require a genome-wide survey of replication origins and their mapping on chromosomes. A microarray technology was applied to obtain a genome-wide profile of DNA replication and to classify early firing origins. RESULTS: A total of 260 potential replication origins (PROs) were identified in the entire budding yeast genome: 247 as defined peaks on the replication profile and 13 as regions located in the chromosomal termini. Based on the firing time, the 247 PROs were classified into 143 early PROs and 104 late PROs, that were not randomly distributed on chromosomes but formed separated clusters. Most of the early PROs were found to fire in the presence of hydroxyurea, indicating that they were free from the control of the intra-S-checkpoint mediated by Mec1 and Rad53. CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring method of DNA replication and the analysis method of microarray data used in this study proved powerful for obtaining a genome-wide view of the initiation and progression of DNA replication.
