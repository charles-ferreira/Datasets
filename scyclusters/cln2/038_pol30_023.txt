Interaction with PCNA is essential for yeast DNA polymerase eta function.

In both yeast and humans, DNA polymerase (Pol) eta functions in error-free replication of ultraviolet-damaged DNA, and Poleta promotes replication through many other DNA lesions as well. Here, we present evidence for the physical and functional interaction of yeast Poleta with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and show that the interaction with PCNA is essential for the in vivo function of Poleta. Poleta is highly inefficient at inserting a nucleotide opposite an abasic site, but interaction with PCNA greatly stimulates its ability for nucleotide incorporation opposite this lesion. Thus, in addition to having a pivotal role in the targeting of Poleta to the replication machinery stalled at DNA lesions, interaction with PCNA would promote the bypass of certain DNA lesions.
