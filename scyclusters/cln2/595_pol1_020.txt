Positive cis-acting regulatory sequences mediate proper control of POL1 transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The 5'ACGCGT3' MluI motif, which is found in the upstream region of several yeast DNA-synthesis genes which are periodically expressed during the mitotic cell-cycle, is present twice in the 5' non-coding region of the DNA-polymerase alpha gene (POL1). Deletion of the most distal repeat does not affect POL1 transcription, while the adjacent 40 base-pair (bp) downstream sequence is necessary both for the proper level and the fluctuation of POL1 mRNA. This region contains the 5'ACGCGTCGCGT3' sequence, which is sufficient to control periodic transcription of a CYC1-lacZ reporter gene with the same kinetics observed for POL1. The adjacent 29 bp AT-rich region does not show any activity by itself, but it acts synergistically in conjunction with at least one MluI hexamer to stimulate CYC1-lacZ expression. By further deletion analysis, DNA sequences necessary to initiate POL1 transcription at the proper sites have also been identified.
