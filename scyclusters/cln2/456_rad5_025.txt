Comparison of sensitivity and liquid holding recovery in rad mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae inactivated by UV and DEB.

Twenty one UV-sensitive rad mutants were tested for their sensitivity towards DEB. All mutants were more sensitive to this treatment than the wild type. Seven mutants were classified as supersensitive to DEB (rad 1-1, 2,3, 6, 15 and 18-2), while only rad2 and rad3 can be classified as supersensitive to UV. For all mutants ability for liquid holding recovery (LHR) after UV and DEB was compared. Mutants rad 1-1, 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11 differ in their response to LH after the two treatments. Survival of rad1-1 and rad3 increases signficantly during LH after DEB but not after UV exposure. In contrast rad5, 6, 11, and 22 show marked LHR after UV but no increase of survival after DEB treatment.
