The rad18 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe defines a new subgroup of the SMC superfamily involved in DNA repair.

The rad18 mutant of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is very sensitive to killing by both UV and gamma radiation. We have cloned and sequenced the rad18 gene and isolated and sequenced its homolog from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, designated RHC18. The predicted Rad18 protein has all the structural properties characteristic of the SMC family of proteins, suggesting a motor function--the first implicated in DNA repair. Gene deletion shows that both rad18 and RHC18 are essential for proliferation. Genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that the product of the rad18 gene acts in a DNA repair pathway for removal of UV-induced DNA damage that is distinct from classical nucleotide excision repair. This second repair pathway involves the products of the rhp51 gene (the homolog of the RAD51 gene of S. cerevisiae) and the rad2 gene.
