Cloning and expression of the Xenopus and mouse Msh2 DNA mismatch repair genes.

Bacterial MutS protein and its yeast and human homologs MSH2 trigger the mismatch repair process by their initial binding to mispaired and unpaired bases in DNA. We describe the cloning and sequencing of genes from Xenopus laevis and Mus musculus encoding the homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH2 (the major DNA mismatch binding protein). Mutations in the human homolog of this gene have recently been implicated in microsatellite instability and DNA mismatch repair deficiency in tumour cells from patients with the most common hereditary predisposition to cancer (Lynch syndrome, or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC), as well as in a significant percentage of sporadic tumours. Expression of the amphibian and murine Msh2 gene in different tissues appears to be ubiquitous. The Xenopus gene is highly expressed in eggs, a model system for the biochemistry of DNA mismatch repair. Expression of the murine gene is low in all tissues examined, and is relatively high in a rapidly dividing cell line. These data are suggestive of a role for MSH2 during DNA replication.
