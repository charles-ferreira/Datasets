The sequence of a 21.3 kb DNA fragment from the left arm of yeast chromosome XIV reveals LEU4, MET4, POL1, RAS2, and six new open reading frames.

The nucleotide sequence of a fragment of 21 308 bp from the left arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XIV has been determined. Analysis of the sequence revealed 13 open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 300 bp, four of which correspond to the previously identified genes LEU4, MET4, POL1 and RAS2. One putative protein, N2160, shares considerable homology (32% identity) with a hypothetical protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome XV as well as with human OCRL protein (36% identity), involved in Lowe's syndrome. N2185 contains ten predicted transmembrane segments and is similar to another putative protein (YKL146) from yeast.
