The DAC2/FUS3 protein kinase is not essential for transcriptional activation of the mating pheromone response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The DAC2/FUS3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes a CDC28/cdc2-related protein kinase, is essential both for the arrest of cell division induced by mating pheromones and for cell fusion during conjugation. To elucidate the role of the DAC2 gene product in the pheromone response pathway, I determined the nucleotide sequence of the DAC2 gene and characterized two types of deletion mutants of the DAC2 gene. Here, I show that the DAC2 gene is identical to the FUS3 gene and that dac2/fus3 deletion mutants respond to mating pheromones by activating transcription. Therefore, the DAC2/FUS3 gene is not essential for transcriptional activation in the pheromone response pathway. The DAC2/FUS3 protein kinase has a positive role in cell fusion during sexual conjugation.
