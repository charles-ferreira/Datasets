DNA ligase-AMP adducts: identification of yeast DNA ligase polypeptides.

Yeast DNA ligase is radioactively labelled in vitro by incubating a crude cell extract with [alpha-32P]ATP. The product of this reaction is the stable covalent ligase-AMP adduct, which can be characterized by its reactivity with either pyrophosphate or nicked DNA and visualized by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA ligase was identified as an 89 kDa polypeptide by exploiting the fact that transformants with multiple copies of the plasmid-encoded DNA ligase (CDC9) gene overproduce the enzyme by two orders of magnitude. A similar strategy has been used to identify the Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA ligase as an 87 kDa polypeptide. Both values agree well with the coding capacities of the respective cloned gene sequences. When the S. cerevisiae ligase is greatly overproduced with respect to wild-type levels, a second polypeptide of 78.5 kDa is also labelled and has the same properties as the 89 kDa adduct. We suggest that this polypeptide is generated by proteolysis.
