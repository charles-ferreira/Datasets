The POL1 gene from the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, shows conserved amino acid blocks specific for eukaryotic DNA polymerases alpha.

The POL1 gene of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, was isolated using a POL1 gene probe from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cloned and sequenced. This gene is unique and located on chromosome II. It includes a single 91 bp intron and is transcribed into a mRNA of about 4500 nucleotides. The predicted protein coded for by the S. pombe POL1 gene is 1405 amino acid long and its calculated molecular weight is about 160,000 daltons. This peptide contains seven amino acid blocks conserved among several DNA polymerases from different organisms and shares overall 37% and 34% identity with DNA polymerases alpha from S. cerevisiae and human cells, respectively. These results indicate that this gene codes for the S. pombe catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha. The comparisons with human DNA polymerase alpha and with the budding yeast DNA polymerases alpha, delta and epsilon reveal conserved blocks of amino acids which are structurally and/or functionally specific only for eukaryotic alpha-type DNA polymerases.
