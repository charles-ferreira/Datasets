Expansions and contractions in 36-bp minisatellites by gene conversion in yeast.

The instability of simple tandem repeats, such as human minisatellite loci, has been suggested to arise by gene conversions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a double-strand break (DSB) was created by the HO endonuclease so that DNA polymerases associated with gap repair must traverse an artificial minisatellite of perfect 36-bp repeats or a yeast Y' minisatellite containing diverged 36-bp repeats. Gene conversions are frequently accompanied by changes in repeat number when the template contains perfect repeats. When the ends of the DSB have nonhomologous tails of 47 and 70 nucleotides that must be removed before repair DNA synthesis can begin, 16% of gene conversions had rearrangements, most of which were contractions, almost always in the recipient locus. When efficient removal of nonhomologous tails was prevented in rad1 and msh2 strains, repair was reduced 10-fold, but among survivors there was a 10-fold reduction in contractions. Half the remaining events were expansions. A similar decrease in the contraction rate was observed when the template was modified so that DSB ends were homologous to the template; and here, too, half of the remaining rearrangements were expansions. In this case, efficient repair does not require RAD1 and MSH2, consistent with our previous observations. In addition, without nonhomologous DSB ends, msh2 and rad1 mutations did not affect the frequency or the distribution of rearrangements. We conclude that the presence of nonhomologous ends alters the mechanism of DSB repair, likely through early recruitment of repair proteins including Msh2p and Rad1p, resulting in more frequent contractions of repeated sequences.
