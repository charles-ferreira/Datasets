Role of Ndt80, Sum1, and Swe1 as targets of the meiotic recombination checkpoint that control exit from pachytene and spore formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The meiotic recombination checkpoint, which is triggered by defects in recombination or chromosome synapsis, arrests sporulating cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at pachytene by preventing accumulation of active Clb-Cdc28. We compared the effects of manipulating the three known targets of the meiotic recombination checkpoint, NDT80, SWE1, and SUM1, in dmc1-arrested cells. Ndt80 is an activator of a set of middle sporulation-specific genes (MSGs), which includes CLB genes and genes involved in spore wall formation; Swe1 inhibits Clb-Cdc28 activity; and Sum1 is a repressor of NDT80 and some MSGs. Activation of the checkpoint leads to inhibition of Ndt80 activity and to stabilization of Swe1 and Sum1. Thus, dmc1-arrested cells fail to express MSGs, arrest at pachytene, and do not form spores. Our study shows that dmc1/dmc1 sum1/sum1 cells expressed MSGs prematurely and at high levels, entered the meiotic divisions efficiently, and in some cases formed asci containing mature spores. In contrast, dmc1/dmc1 swe1/swe1 cells expressed MSGs at a very low level, were inefficient and delayed in entry into the meiotic divisions, and never formed mature spores. We found that cells of dmc1/dmc1 sum1/sum1 ndt80/ndt80 and dmc1/dmc1 swe1/swe1 ndt80/ndt80 strains arrested at pachytene and that dmc1/dmc1 or dmc1/dmc1 swe1/swe1 cells overexpressing NDT80 were less efficient in bypassing checkpoint-mediated arrest than dmc1/dmc1 sum1/sum1 cells. Our results are consistent with previous suggestions that increased Clb-Cdc28 activity, caused by mutation of SWE1 or by an NDT80-dependent increase in CLB expression, allows dmc1/dmc1 cells to exit pachytene and that subsequent upregulation of Ndt80 activity by a feedback mechanism promotes entry into the meiotic divisions. Spore morphogenesis, however, requires efficient and timely activation of MSGs, which we speculate was achieved in dmc1/dmc1 sum1/sum1 cells by premature expression of NDT80.
