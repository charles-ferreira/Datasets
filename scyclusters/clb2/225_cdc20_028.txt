Cell cycle-regulated expression, phosphorylation, and degradation of p55Cdc. A mammalian homolog of CDC20/Fizzy/slp1.

p55Cdc is a mammalian protein that shows high homology to the cell cycle proteins Cdc20p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the product of the Drosophila fizzy (fzy) gene, both of which contain WD repeats and are thought to be required for the metaphase-anaphase transition. The fzy mutants exhibit a metaphase arrest phenotype, which is accompanied by stabilization of cyclins A and B, leading to the hypothesis that fzy function is required for cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. p55Cdc expression was initiated at the G1/S transition and steady state levels of p55Cdc were highest at M and lowest in G1. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome prevented both mitotic exit and loss of p55Cdc at the M/G1 transition, suggesting that p55Cdc degradation was mediated by the cell cycle-regulated proteolytic pathway. Immune complexes of p55Cdc obtained at different cell cycle stages showed a variety of proteins with dramatic differences observed in the pattern of associated proteins during the transition from G2 to M. Immunolocalization of p55Cdc demonstrated dynamic changes in p55Cdc localization as the cells transit mitosis. p55Cdc appears to act as a regulatory protein interacting with several other proteins, perhaps via its seven WD repeats, at multiple points in the cell cycle.
