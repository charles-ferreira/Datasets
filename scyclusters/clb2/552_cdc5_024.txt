Centromeric regions control autonomous segregation tendencies in single-division meiosis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

We have previously shown that yeast cdc5 or cdc14 homozygotes can be led through a single-division meiosis in which some of the chromosomes segregate reductionally whereas others, within the same cell, segregate equationally. Chromosomes XI tend to segregate reductionally, whereas chromosomes IV tend to segregate equationally. In this report we present experiments with cdc5 homozygous strains, in which the centromeres of one or both chromosomes XI was replaced by the centromeric region from chromosome IV. Analysis of the products of single-division meioses in these strains demonstrates that the choice between reductional or equational segregation is directed by sequences in the vicinity of the centromeres. Although the choice is made separately for each individual chromosome, the analysis also reveals the existence of a system responsible for coordinated segregation of the two chromosomes of a given pair.
