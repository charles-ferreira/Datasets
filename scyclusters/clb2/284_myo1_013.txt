Genetic and functional relationship between Rvsp, myosin and actin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The rvs mutants display phenotypes close to those described for the actin mutants: disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, random budding of the diploids, loss of polarity and sensitivity to salt. Mutations in the RVS genes lead to synthetic lethality with a set of mutations in the actin gene, ACT1. This synthetic lethality is allele-specific regarding the act1 mutations, pointing to a region on the actin molecule where contacts with the myosin head have been described. The possible involvement of a myosin in a vital function fulfilled both by the Rvsp proteins and actin is strengthened further by the fact that the double mutants rvs167, myo1 and rvs167, myo2 are lethal and severely affected in growth respectively. These data support the idea that actin, myosin and Rvsp proteins are linked in a common functional pathway in yeast.
