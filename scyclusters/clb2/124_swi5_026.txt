The role of phosphorylation and the CDC28 protein kinase in cell cycle-regulated nuclear import of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor SWI5.

The intracellular localization of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor SWI5 is cell cycle dependent. The protein is nuclear in G1 cells but cytoplasmic in S, G2, and M phase cells. We have identified SWI5's nuclear localization signal (NLS) and show that it can confer cell cycle-dependent nuclear entry to a heterologous protein. Located within or close to the NLS are three serine residues, mutation of which results in constitutive nuclear entry. These residues are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in vivo, being phosphorylated when SWI5 is in the cytoplasm and dephosphorylated when it is in the nucleus. As all three serines are phosphorylated by purified CDC28-dependent H1 kinase activity in vitro, we propose a model in which the CDC28 kinase acts directly to control nuclear entry of SWI5.
