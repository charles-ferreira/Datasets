Cloning and characterisation of a carrot cDNA coding for a WD repeat protein homologous to Drosophila fizzy, human p55CDC and yeast CDC20 proteins.

The present study describes the isolation of a cDNA coding for a carrot protein of 450 amino acids that contains WD repeats (DcWD1) and is homologous to Drosophila melanogaster fizzy protein, mammalian p55CDC and yeast Cdc20p. As for the known related proteins, sequence conservation concerned the majority of the polypeptide except the far N-terminus. Results of Southern blot analysis with genomic DNA under high stringency conditions showed the occurrence of a single gene. Northern blot analyses revealed the accumulation of DcWD1 mRNA in all tested tissues (leaves, petioles and hypocotyls, apical meristems, roots and suspension cultured cells), though at a different extent. Lack of induction of relevant transcripts in proliferating auxin-stimulated hypocotyls suggests a mode of expression not strictly related to the cell proliferation.
