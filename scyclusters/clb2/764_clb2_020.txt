Genes involved in sister chromatid separation are needed for B-type cyclin proteolysis in budding yeast.

B-type cyclin destruction is necessary for exit from mitosis and the initiation of a new cell cycle. Through the isolation of mutants, we have identified three essential yeast genes, CDC16, CDC23, and CSE1, which are required for proteolysis of the B-type cyclin CLB2 but not of other unstable proteins. cdc23-1 mutants are defective in both entering and exiting anaphase. Their failure to exit anaphase can be explained by defective cyclin proteolysis. CDC23 is required at the metaphase/anaphase transition to separate sister chromatids, and we speculate that it might promote proteolysis of proteins that hold sister chromatids together. Proteolysis of CLB2 is initiated in early anaphase, but a fraction of CLB2 remains stable until anaphase is complete.
