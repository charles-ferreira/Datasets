Elevated recombination and pairing structures during meiotic arrest in yeast of the nuclear division mutant cdc5.

A diploid strain of yeast, homozygous for the mutation cdc5-1, undergoes a normal meiosis at 25 degrees C. At the nonpermissive temperature of 34 degrees C, meiosis is arrested at the first meiotic division, after premeiotic DNA replication and recombination commitment have taken place. Haploidisation commitment does not occur at 34 degrees C. Electron microscopy reveals that synaptons (synaptonemal complexes) are formed and the stage of arrest is characterised by a prevalence of &quot;modified synaptons&quot;, which consist of paired lateral elements lacking the central elements. Prolonged incubation at this stage of arrest results in unusually high recombination levels, perhaps related to the synaptonal structures observed. Temperature shift-up experiments (transfers of cell from 25 degrees C to 34 degrees C at various times during meiosis) reveal that the CDC5 function is required for both the first and the second divisions of meiosis.
