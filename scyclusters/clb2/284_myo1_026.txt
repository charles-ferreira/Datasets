Yeast myosin heavy chain mutant: maintenance of the cell type specific budding pattern and the normal deposition of chitin and cell wall components requires an intact myosin heavy chain gene.

Recent studies with myosin heavy chain mutants in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that the myosin heavy chain gene is not essential for cell survival under laboratory growth conditions. However, cells lacking a normal myosin heavy chain gene demonstrate substantial alterations in growth and cell division. In this study, we report that a disruption mutant in the rod portion of the yeast myosin heavy chain gene, MYO1, produces abnormal chitin distribution and cell wall organization at the mother-bud neck in a high proportion of dividing cells. It is suggested that this phenotype is the cause of the cell division defect and the osmotic sensitivity of yeast MYO1 mutants. In the absence of a normal MYO1 polypeptide, yeast cells alter their cell type specific budding pattern. It is concluded that an intact myosin heavy chain gene is required to maintain the cell type specific budding pattern and the correct localization and deposition of chitin and cell wall components during cell growth and division.
