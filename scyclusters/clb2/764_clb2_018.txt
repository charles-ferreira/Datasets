Cell cycle-regulated transcription of the CLB2 gene is dependent on Mcm1 and a ternary complex factor.

Clb2 is the major B-type mitotic cyclin required for entry into mitosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We showed that accumulation of CLB2 transcripts in G2 cells is controlled at the transcriptional level and identified a 55-bp upstream activating sequence (UAS) containing an Mcm1 binding site as being necessary and sufficient for cell cycle regulation. Sequences within the cell cycle-regulated UAS were shown to bind Mcm1 in vitro, and mutation which abolished Mcm1-dependent DNA binding activity eliminated cell cycle-regulated transcription in vivo. A second protein with no autonomous DNA binding activity was also recruited into Mcm1-UAS complexes, generating a ternary complex. A point mutation in the CLB2 UAS which blocked ternary complex formation, but still allowed Mcm1 to bind, resulted in loss of cell cycle regulation in vivo, suggesting that the ternary complex factor is also important in control of CLB2 transcription. We discuss the possibility that the CLB2 gene is coregulated with other genes known to be regulated with the same periodicity and suggest that Mcm1 and the ternary complex factor may coordinately regulate several other G2-regulated transcripts.
