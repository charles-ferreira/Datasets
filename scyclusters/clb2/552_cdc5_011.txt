Disruption of the YRB2 gene retards nuclear protein export, causing a profound mitotic delay, and can be rescued by overexpression of XPO1/CRM1.

Disruption of the YRB2 gene encoding a nuclear Ran-binding protein homologous to Yrb1p/RanBP1 makes Saccharomyces cerevisiae cold sensitive for colony-formation, but not for growth in liquid medium. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Hba1p, which is homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yrb2p, rescued the cold sensitivity of Deltayrb2 cells. When released from an alpha factor block, Deltayrb2 cells underwent a prolonged delay at the short spindle stage of mitosis with a normal level of Clb/p34(CDC28) kinase activity, but there was no chromosome loss, this being consistent with the finding that Deltayrb2 was synthetic lethal with neither Deltamad1 nor Deltamad3. The cold sensitive colony-formation of Deltayrb2 cells was rescued by both XPO1/CRM1 and GSP1, but not CDC5, carried on a multicopy vector. XPO1/CRM1 rescued Deltayrb2 even in a single copy. Consistent with such a tight functional interaction, Xpo1p/Crm1p directly bound to Yrb2p, but not Yrb1p, and Deltayrb2 cells were found to have a defect in nuclear export signal (NES)-dependent nuclear protein export. From these results together, the ability of Xpo1/Crm1p to export NES-proteins is suggested to be enhanced by both Yrb2p and Gsp1p, and thereby disruption of YRB2 retards nuclear protein export, resulting in the mitotic delay.
