Cdc55p, the B-type regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, has multiple functions in mitosis and is required for the kinetochore/spindle checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like most eucaryotic cells, can prevent the onset of anaphase until chromosomes are properly aligned on the mitotic spindle. We determined that Cdc55p (regulatory B subunit of protein phosphatase 2A [PP2A]) is required for the kinetochore/spindle checkpoint regulatory pathway in yeast. ctf13 cdc55 double mutants could not maintain a ctf13-induced mitotic delay, as determined by antitubulin staining and levels of histone H1 kinase activity. In addition, cdc55::LEU2 mutants and tpd3::LEU2 mutants (regulatory A subunit of PP2A) were nocodazole sensitive and exhibited the phenotypes of previously identified kinetochore/spindle checkpoint mutants. Inactivating CDC55 did not simply bypass the arrest that results from inhibiting ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis because cdc16-1 cdc55::LEU2 and cdc23-1 cdc55::LEU2 double mutants arrested normally at elevated temperatures. CDC55 is specific for the kinetochore/spindle checkpoint because cdc55 mutants showed normal sensitivity to gamma radiation and hydroxyurea. The conditional lethality and the abnormal cellular morphogenesis of cdc55::LEU2 were suppressed by cdc28F19, suggesting that the cdc55 phenotypes are dependent on the phosphorylation state of Cdc28p. In contrast, the nocodazole sensitivity of cdc55::LEU2 was not suppressed by cdc28F19. Therefore, the mitotic checkpoint activity of CDC55 (and TPD3) is independent of regulated phosphorylation of Cdc28p. Finally, cdc55::LEU2 suppresses the temperature sensitivity of cdc20-1, suggesting additional roles for CDC55 in mitosis.
