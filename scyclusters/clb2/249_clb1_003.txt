Cdc28 and Ime2 possess redundant functions in promoting entry into premeiotic DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae initiation and progression through the mitotic cell cycle are determined by the sequential activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. The role of this kinase in entry and progression through the meiotic cycle is unclear, since all cdc28 temperature-sensitive alleles are leaky for meiosis. We used a &quot;heat-inducible Degron system&quot; to construct a diploid strain homozygous for a temperature-degradable cdc28-deg allele. We show that this allele is nonleaky, giving no asci at the nonpermissive temperature. We also show, using this allele, that Cdc28 is not required for premeiotic DNA replication and commitment to meiotic recombination. IME2 encodes a meiosis-specific hCDK2 homolog that is required for the correct timing of premeiotic DNA replication, nuclear divisions, and asci formation. Moreover, in ime2Delta diploids additional rounds of DNA replication and nuclear divisions are observed. We show that the delayed premeiotic DNA replication observed in ime2Delta diploids depends on a functional Cdc28. Ime2Delta cdc28-4 diploids arrest prior to initiation of premeiotic DNA replication and meiotic recombination. Ectopic overexpression of Clb1 at early meiotic times advances premeiotic DNA replication, meiotic recombination, and nuclear division, but the coupling between these events is lost. The role of Ime2 and Cdc28 in initiating the meiotic pathway is discussed.
