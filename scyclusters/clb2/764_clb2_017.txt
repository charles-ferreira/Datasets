The yeast CDC16 and CDC27 genes restrict DNA replication to once per cell cycle.

CDC16 and CDC27 were identified as genes in S. cerevisiae necessary to limit DNA replication to once per cell cycle. A screen for mutants that overreplicated their DNA uncovered new conditional alleles that cause accumulation of up to 8C DNA. DNA overreplication involves all chromosomes and does not require passage through mitosis or another START. It occurs within a single cell cycle and can cause arrest at the MEC1 checkpoint. Remarkably, Clb2-Cdc28 activity remains elevated in the overreplicating cells. These observations distinguish CDC16 and CDC27 from other mutants that accumulate extra DNA after completing an aberrent mitosis, or skipping mitosis altogether, and entering a second, inappropriate G1 and S phase. CDC16 and CDC27 may contribute to replication control by targeted proteolysis of an S phase initiator.
