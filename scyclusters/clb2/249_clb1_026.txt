The role of cdc2 and other genes in meiosis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

The requirement of the cdc2, cdc13 and cdc25 genes for meiosis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was investigated using three different conditions to induce meiosis. These genes were known to be required for meiosis II. cdc13 and cdc25 are essential for meiosis I. The cdc2 gene, which is required for the initiation of both mitotic S-phase and M-phase, is essential for premeiotic DNA synthesis and meiosis II. The requirement of cdc2 for meiosis I was unclear. This contrasts with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where CDC28, the homolog of cdc2, is required for meiosis I but not for premeiotic DNA synthesis. Expression of cdc13 and cdc25 was induced after premeiotic DNA synthesis, reaching a sharp peak before the first nuclear division. Expression of cdc22, encoding the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, was also induced but the peak was before premeiotic DNA synthesis. The induction of cdc13 and cdc25 was largely dependent on DNA synthesis and the function of the mei4 gene. The mei4 gene itself was also induced in a DNA synthesis-dependent manner. The chain of gene expression activating cdc25 may be important as part of the mechanism that ensures the dependency of nuclear division on DNA replication during meiosis.
