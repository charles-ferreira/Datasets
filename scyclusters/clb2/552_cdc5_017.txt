A novel role for Cdc5p in DNA replication.

DNA replication initiates from specific chromosomal sites called origins, and in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae these sites are occupied by the origin recognition complex (ORC). Dbf4p is proposed to play a role in targeting the G1/S kinase Cdc7p to initiation complexes late in G1. We report that Dbf4p may also recruit Cdc5p to origin complexes. Cdc5p is a member of the Polo family of kinases that is required for the completion of mitosis. Cdc5p and Cdc7p each interact with a distinct domain of Dbf4p. cdc5-1 mutants have a plasmid maintenance defect that can be suppressed by the addition of multiple origins. cdc5-1 orc2-1 double mutants are synthetically lethal. Levels of Cdc5p were found to be cell cycle regulated and peaked in G2/M. These results suggest a role for Cdc5p and possibly Polo-like kinases at origin complexes.
