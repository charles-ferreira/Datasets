The dynamics of chromosome movement in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Nuclear DNA movement in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was analyzed in live cells using digital imaging microscopy and corroborated by the analysis of nuclear DNA position in fixed cells. During anaphase, the replicated nuclear genomes initially separated at a rate of 1 micron/min. As the genomes separated, the rate of movement became discontinuous. In addition, the axis defined by the segregating genomes rotated relative to the cell surface. The similarity between these results and those previously obtained in higher eukaryotes suggest that the mechanism of anaphase movement may be highly conserved. Before chromosome separation, novel nuclear DNA movements were observed in cdc13, cdc16, and cdc23 cells but not in wild-type or cdc20 cells. These novel nuclear DNA movements correlated with variability in spindle position and length in cdc16 cells. Models for the mechanism of these movements and their induction by certain cdc mutants are discussed.
