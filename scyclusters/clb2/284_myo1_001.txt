Septins, under Cla4p regulation, and the chitin ring are required for neck integrity in budding yeast.

CLA4, encoding a protein kinase of the PAK type, and CDC11, encoding a septin, were isolated in a screen for synthetic lethality with CHS3, which encodes the chitin synthase III catalytic moiety. Although Ste20p shares some essential function with Cla4p, it did not show synthetic lethality with Chs3p. cla4 and cdc11 mutants exhibited similar morphological and septin localization defects, including aberrant and ectopic septa. Myo1p, which requires septins for localization, formed abnormally wide rings in cla4 mutants. In cultures started with unbudded cells, an inhibitor of Chs3p activity, nikkomycin Z, aggravated the abnormalities of cla4 and cdc11 mutants and gave rise to enlarged necks at the mother-bud junction, leading to cell death. It is concluded that Cla4p is required for the correct localization and/or assembly of the septin ring and that both the septin ring and the Chs3p-requiring chitin ring at the mother-bud neck cooperate in maintaining the neck constricted throughout the cell cycle, a vital function in budding yeast.
