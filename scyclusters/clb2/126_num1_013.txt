The NUM1 yeast gene: length polymorphism and physiological aspects of mutant phenotype.

We have isolated a mutant (rvs272) of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that displays an altered phenotype in stationary phase. It shows a high proportion of large-budded cells with two non-segregated nuclei staying in the mother cell. This phenotype is also expressed in various conditions when cells are synchronized, energy depleted or treated with the antimitotic drug benomyl. The RVS272 gene has been identified as the NUM1 gene already described. This gene presents a 192 bp tandemly repeated motif and we show that the number of repeats can vary from 1 to about 24 among different strains, without apparently affecting the function of the encoded protein. We suggest that this protein could be involved in polymerization catalysis and/or stabilization of microtubules.
