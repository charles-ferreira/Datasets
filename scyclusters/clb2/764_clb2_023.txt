Mutations in PRG1, a yeast proteasome-related gene, cause defects in nuclear division and are suppressed by deletion of a mitotic cyclin gene.

Proteasomes are ubiquitous complexes exhibiting proteolytic activity in vitro. The function(s) of these enzymes in vivo is not known. To investigate the in vivo role of proteasomes, four temperature-sensitive alleles of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome-related gene, PRG1, were constructed and analyzed. At both the permissive and restrictive temperatures, many prg1 cells have a large bud, contain replicated DNA, and have their nucleus positioned at the neck with a short spindle. These different phenotypes indicate a defect in nuclear division. Consistent with a nuclear division defect, prg1 mutant strains lose a dispensable chromosome at a higher frequency than wild-type cells. Importantly, deletion of CLB2, a gene encoding a mitotic cyclin, suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of prg1 mutant strains. Our results indicate that proteasomes are important for nuclear division and suggest that they participate in degradation of the Clb2 protein (Clb2p).
